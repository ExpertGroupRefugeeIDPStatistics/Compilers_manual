    2.3 to 2.5 in order to clarify and simplify the steps for dealing
    with the different sources. There are different sub-sections dealing
    with refugees and IDPs in some of the sections.

Design Outputs
-------------------

"This includes the detailed design of the statistical outputs, products
and services to be produced, including the related development work and
preparation of the systems and tools used in the \"Disseminate\" phase.
Disclosure control methods, as well as processes governing access to any
confidential outputs are also designed here.

Outputs should be designed to follow existing standards wherever
possible, so inputs to this process may include metadata from similar or
previous collections, international standards, and information about
practices in other statistical organisations from sub-process 1.1
(Identify needs)." (UNECE, 2013)

### Refugee statistics outputs {#refugee-statistics-outputs .ListParagraph}

61. Basic refugee tabulations are recommended as outputs in the
    guidelines for basic tabulations in Chapter 3 of IRRS. In addition,
    there are analytical recommendations in Chapter 5 of the IRRS which
    propose a list of indicators for measuring refugee integration and
    the measurement of their immediate and ongoing needs (see IRRS,
    Table 5.1), these are closely aligned with the SDGs. These
    recommendations may need to be modified in response to national
    needs as determined in Phase 1 (1.1. Identify the Needs of Users and
    Potential Users) of this manual.

2)  #### Refugee flow tabulations

3)  #### Refugee stock indicators

<!-- -->

62. In addition to tabulations key indicators for the refugee and
    refugee related populations are shown below.

Table 2.3: Refugee Stock indicators

63. Stock indicators are recommended for all three categories of refugee
    and refugee related populations, whereas flow indicators are
    recommended only for those in need of international protection, and
    not for those with a refugee background or returned to their country
    of habitual residence.

Table 2.4: Refugee Flow Indicators

### IDP statistics outputs {#idp-statistics-outputs .ListParagraph}

64. Basic tabulations are recommended as outputs in the guidelines for
    basic stock and flow tabulations in Chapter 5 of IRIS. These
    recommendations may need to be modified in response to national
    needs as determined in Phase 1 (1.1. Identify the Needs of Users and
    Potential Users) of this Manual.

65. IDP statistics are separated into four population groups; a) Persons
    who have displacement-related protection needs (subdivided into IDPs
    in locations of displacement, IDPs in location of return, and IDPs
    in other settlement locations); b) IDP-related populations who are
    the children born after displacement to at least one IDP parent; c)
    Other non-displaced family members of IDPs; and d) Those who have
    overcome key displacement-related vulnerabilities. (See IRIS Figure
    3.1 page 26).

66. The Section C of IRIS suggests basic flow tabulations divided into
    inflow, outflows and flows between sub-stocks, while Section D
    recommends basic stock tabulations.

#### IDP and IDP-related population flow tabulations

67. The in-flow tabulations distinguish between a) IDPs with protection
    needs and b) IDP-related populations. Capturing flows may be
    difficult and challenging for national statistical systems depending
    on the data collection methodology used. The flows of IDPs are more
    complex to estimate than the flows of refugees, as the ending of IDP
    status is not legally defined in international law as is the case
    for refugees. IDP status ceases when a durable solution has been
    reached, and this can only be achieved if displacement related
    vulnerabilities have been overcome according to the IASC framework
    on durable solutions (see IRIS, 2020 Chapter 4).

68. The IRIS proposes a methodology to measure the progress that IDPs
    have made in overcoming key displacement-related vulnerabilities,
    and to assess statistically when IDPs have reached a durable
    solution and can be taken out of the IDP stock. The methodology is
    to be tested in a variety of contexts and will be amended to take
    account of country conditions.

Table 2.5: Flows of IDPs and IDP-Related Populations

#### IDP and IDP-related population stocks tabulations

69. The most basic statistics are the counts of IDP and IDP-related
    persons, the tabulations recommended below represent the basis
    analysis of IDP stocks

70. Chapter 4, Section C of IRIS, 2020 recommends a measure of the
    progress made by IDPs in overcoming their displacement related
    vulnerabilities. Basic progress statistics for IDPs are recommended
    for capturing their progress towards reaching durable solutions,
    measured against a reference population, either the national or
    regional average, or the host community.

71. population (see IRIS, 2020 paras 145 to 157).

####  {#section .ListParagraph}

#### Key IDP Stock Indicators

72. In addition to the basic tabulations a set of key indicators for the
    stock estimates of IDPs and IDP-related persons have also been
    recommended. For people who have overcome key displacement
    vulnerabilities indicators i, ii and viii to x apply.

Table 2.8: Key stock indicators of IDP, IDP-related, and those who have
overcome key displacement related vulnerabilities

Design variable descriptions
---------------------------------

> "This sub-process defines the statistical variables to be collected
> via the collection instrument, as well as any other variables that
> will be derived from them in sub-process 5.5 (Derive new variables and
> units), and any statistical classifications that will be used. It is
> expected that existing national and international standards will be
> followed wherever possible.
>
> This sub-process may need to run in parallel with sub-process 2.3
> (Design collection), as the definition of the variables to be
> collected, and the choice of collection instrument may be
> inter-dependent to some degree"[^1]. (UNECE, 2013)

74. Preparation of metadata descriptions of both collected and derived
    variables and classifications is needed for subsequent phases of the
    statistical process. The lists of variables described below may be
    modified and supplemented by the users' needs as described in *Phase
    1 of this Manual.*

-   The variables and classifications recommended refer to guidelines in
    Chapter 3 of IRRS (2018) and Chapter 5 of IRIS (2020).

### Variables for refugee statistics {#variables-for-refugee-statistics .ListParagraph}

75. Most of the variables to be used are common to other areas of social
    statistics, but several are unique to refugee statistics. The
    classifications of asylum seekers, refugees and those with a refugee
    background ae unique, and more detail can be found in IRRS
    Chapter 3. These variables required are set out in below in *Table
    2.9: Variables for refugee statistics*.

76. Variable xi in the table, *Legal residential/international
    protection status as applicable to the national context* in the
    table refers to the persons legal status in respect of international
    protection. The classification is set out in IRRS (2018) Figure 3.1
    and reproduced here in *Table 2.10: Classification of legal
    protection status of refugees and refugee related populations.*

77. Another variable that is unique to displacement statistics is linked
    to the legal concept of place or country of habitual residence. This
    refers to the place or country where a person was usually resident
    at the time they were displaced. This concept occurs in variable
    viii listed below for refugee statistics and in IDP statistics.

78. The usual place or country of residence is where a person is living
    now, and has been or intends to continue living for one year. The
    habitual place of residence is the place or country from where the
    person was displaced. IRIS (2020) Box 3.3 describes the differences.
    The concepts are equally applicable to country and place of
    residence. The concept is used in the *Bosnia and Herzegovina Case
    Study* (see paragraph *537 onwards)* and captures the address before
    the war and the current address in its Database of Displaced Persons
    (DDPR). Georgia asks in its census "Where are you a refugee from"
    (see paragraph 579).

Table 2.9: Variables for refugee statistics

Table 2.10: Classification of legal protection status of refugees and
refugee related populations

### Variables for IDP statistics {#variables-for-idp-statistics .ListParagraph}

79. The list of variables for IDP statistics is very similar to those of
    refugees but omits the international migration related questions and
    includes the date of first and last displacement. The reason for
    displacement is required in a more extensive form, and the type of
    dwelling or habitation they are currently living in is also
    required. In order to identify the IDP-related population the IDP
    status of parents is also required.

Table 2.11: Variables for IDP statistics

80. Variables vii and viii are used to assess whether or not individuals
    have returned to their habitual place of residence. This return
    enables the IDP to be classified according to the three sub-stocks
    (see IRIS, 2020 Figure 3.1 - i. IDPs in locations of
    displacement, ii. IDPs in locations of return, and iii. IDPs in
    other settlement locations) and to be counted as flow within the
    stock.

81. As a simple return does not mean that IDPs have overcome all their
    displacement related vulnerabilities, additional variables will be
    needed to assess the IDPs progress and to contribute to the
    composite measure to assess overcoming key displacement-related
    vulnerabilities. The *Criteria and sub-criteria included in the
    Composite Measure of Overcoming Displacement-Related
    Vulnerabilities* is explained in the IRIS Chapter 4 and is
    illustrated in Figure 4.3 reproduced below. The same chapter
    discusses the choice of the variables to be used, and future
    progress on recommendations made will be included in future versions
    of this Manual.

82. Therefore, in addition to classificatory variables described above,
    a set of variables should be chosen to assess the IDPs progress
    towards overcoming their displacement related vulnerabilities.
    *Table 2.12: Criteria and sub-criteria included in the composite
    measure of overcoming displacement-related vulnerabilities* lists
    the criteria.

83. To make the assessment of the progress of the IDP and IDP-related
    population a comparator population is needed, this may be the
    general population or sub-national population in the vicinity of the
    initial displacement who have not themselves suffered displacement.
    These variables should also be available in the comparator
    population where relevant to enable comparisons to be made.

Table 2.12: Criteria and sub-criteria included in the composite measure
of overcoming displacement-related vulnerabilities

  ----------------------------------------------- ---- -------------------------------------------

  ----------------------------------------------- ---- -------------------------------------------

84. For each sub-criterion, there are many different indicators which
    can be chosen, although a final list has not yet been agreed. The
    indicators selected in each national context should, as far as
    possible, be aligned with already tested and standardized
    indicators. The Durable Solutions indicator library[^2] provides a
    thorough overview of potential options (see IRIS,2020 paragraph
    127-128). Where relevant, they should also mirror the SDG indicators
    recommended to be disaggregated by different categories of
    displacement. Indicators selected should be carefully chosen to
    ensure they are relevant for all three sub-stocks of the displaced
    population: IDPs in locations of displacement, IDPs in locations of
    return and IDPs in other settlement locations.

85. For the purposes of statistical measurement, to make it as unbiased
    and cost efficient as possible, the following aspects should be
    taken into account when selecting the indicators:

    6.  Commonly used: It is an advantage if the indicator in question
        is collected for other purposes as well to facilitate population
        group comparison and to incorporate displacement analysis into
        existing larger data collection processes. SDG indicators are a
        good example here as most surveys and censuses will cover a
        number of these at least up until 2030.

    7.  Tested and evaluated. Linked to the previous point, it is also
        an advantage to select indicators or questions which have been
        tested and satisfy quality criteria. This is the case for most
        of the indicators and related questions asked in standard
        household surveys, for example on education, food security or
        employment.

    8.  Covering the population in question: There are several potential
        indicators which may be relevant in the context, but do not
        cover all of the population in question.

86. This manual discusses four types of data sources: A. Census of
    Population and Housing, B. Sample Surveys, C. Administrative Data
    and D. Integrated Data Sources. Each of these data sources is
    described in turn, and subprocesses 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5 are separately
    described for each of the sources where relevant.

87. The design of the data collection should at a minimum aim to collect
    data to populate the variables described above in sub-phase 2.2.
    Design variable descriptions. In many cases the data collection
    exercise will need to identify both the refugee and related
    populations, and the IDP and related populations. Compromises may
    need to be made to keep the questioning to manageable proportions.

Data Source A: Censuses of Population and Housing
-------------------------------------------------

### Design collection


"This sub-process determines the most appropriate collection method(s)
and instrument(s). The actual activities in this sub-process will vary
according to the type of collection instruments required, which can
include computer assisted interviewing, paper questionnaires,
administrative data interfaces and data integration techniques. This
sub-process includes the design of collection instruments, questions and
response templates (in conjunction with the variables and statistical
classifications designed in sub-process 2.2 (Design variable
descriptions))". (UNECE, 2013)

88. In designing the Census of Population Housing there are two
    questions to consider:

    9.  Are displaced people included in the census coverage? If so, is
        > it possible to identify them as such in the data?

    10. How coherent are the results when compared to other sources such
        > as surveys and administrative data?

#### EGRIS recommendations {#a.1.-egris-recommendations .ListParagraph}

89. The IRRS, 2018 includes a recommendation on identifying refugees in
    the population census, by asking about the main reason for the
    immigration to the country and allowing for an option on forced
    displacement. If internal migration is also included in a census,
    then there is the potential to screen for IDPs as well as refugees
    by asking similar questions on the reason for internal moves within
    a country. Typically, a census asks about a person's location a year
    ago, and in some cases 5 years ago. Where there have been large
    displacements in a country the date selected often coincides with a
    significant displacement event, as this not only helps people to
    recall where they were on the date chosen improving accuracy, but
    also helps to identify IDPs.

90. The IRIS, 2020 also make census recommendations. Recognising that
    relying on internal migration questions in a census is likely to
    lead to an under-estimation of IDP stocks because the last move of
    an IDP is not always the most relevant one. The limitations are as
    follows;

    11. Place of habitual residence will usually not be identified,

    12. Those who have returned to their habitual place of residence
        within the period specified by the census,

    13. Those who within the period specified by the census have moved
        one or several times after their initial displacement, and

    14. Those who have moved within the same administrative area used in
        census geographical classifications.

91. Ideally every census would ask questions about the reasons for both
    internal and international migration and include a response on
    forced displacement. This would capture IDPs, refugees, asylum
    seekers, those under temporary protection and those returning to
    their country of habitual residence. The reason should refer to the
    main reason for the most recent move. The question should be asked
    of all individuals, not just adults and also be asked to those
    living in camps and other temporary accommodation. Camps are often
    treated as institutional buildings and respondents are asked a brief
    subset of questions which are unsuitable for identifying displaced
    people.

Table 2.13: Census questions for the identification of refugees

#### Institutional questionnaires

92. In many censuses there are several questionnaire forms, there is
    usually one form for a private household and another for
    'institutional establishments'. These institutions often comprise
    schools, hospitals, hotels, workers camps and so on. They may also
    be used to cover camps for IDPs or refugees. Institutional
    questionnaires may not be suitable for camps for the displaced,
    particularly where these are more than short term arrangements. As
    the question content is often much shorter in the institutional
    questionnaire than in the household questionnaire, the information
    will be insufficient to provide for the requirements of users
    interested in displaced people. Wherever possible the camps should
    be enumerated using the questionnaires designed for private
    households.

93. It may also be possible to distinguish the type of camp and to
    record that on the questionnaire forms. The type of living quarter
    as recommended by the UN/ECE manual is a single response question
    including alternatives for "Refugee camp" and "IDP" camp. Use of
    this question makes it possible to distinguish between IDPs and
    Refugees, and "camp dwellers".

#### Questions for IDP populations where displacement is a priority topic for users

94. If it is important to capture the entire IDP population a specific
    set of questions on forced displacement could be asked, but this is
    only likely to be justifiable in cases where there have been major
    national displacements and where;

    15. IDPs have started to return to their places of habitual
        residence and it is expected that they still have key
        displacement related vulnerabilities,

    16. IDPs are expected to have settled elsewhere after their initial
        displacement, but still have key displacement related
        vulnerabilities,

    17. Multiple forced displacements have occurred to the same
        population,

    18. Displacements are expected to have happened within the smallest
        administrative area proposed by the census, or

    19. Displacement might be for a combination of these reasons.

95. The IRIS, 2020 recommends a set of questions for identifying IDPs
    and/or refugees in contexts where users require a more complete
    estimate of stocks and flows than is likely to be obtained from
    using regular internal migration census questions.

    Has \*(NAME) ever been forced to flee? (adding reason)

    If yes;

-   When was this?

-   Where did you move from?

-   Where did you reside before you were forcibly displaced?

-   Where did you move to? (Within country borders/abroad)?

#### UNECE Recommendations for the 2020 Census Round {#a.2.-unece-recommendations-for-the-2020-census-round .ListParagraph}

96. The UNECE makes recommendations for the 2020 Population Census round
    which cover many of the core variables required to screen the
    population for Refugees (♥) and IDPs (♣), although several of the
    items are non-core topics which are at the discretion of countries
    to add. The reason for migration, both international and internal,
    would need to include an answer category which includes the concept
    of forced migration. The UNECE recommendation on the reason for
    international migration is '*admittance for humanitarian or
    political reasons*.

97. The UNECE document also provides a definition of the population
    group "*Population with a refugee background".* The definition of
    this population group includes:

> "(a) Persons who declared that their main reason for migration
> international migration was 'forced migration.' Some examples of
> categories that would qualify as 'forced migration' are; armed
> conflict, situations of general violence, violations of human rights,
> natural or human-made disasters.
>
> \(b)  Foreign-born persons who declared that their main reason for
> migration was 'Family' and are members of the same family nucleus of a
> person in group (a).
>
> \(c)  Native-born children members of the same family nucleus of the
> parents and having both parents in group (a) or one parent in the group
> (a) and the other parent of the group (b)."

Table 2.14: UNECE recommendations in the 2020 Population Census round

98. The UNECE recommendations cover IDPs as a non-core topic in the
    internal migration section, which is defined as "*Internal migrants,
    as identified in the census, are, therefore, specifically defined as
    those who are usually resident in a civil division at the* *census
    reference time and who have previously been resident in another
    civil division within the country*". This is slightly problematic
    for IDPs who need not cross an administrative boundary in order to
    quality as an IDP (IRIS, 2020 paragraph 115). To capture these IDPs
    who do not move administrative areas a direct question about
    displacement may be required for all individuals (see above 49).

99. In paragraph 689 of the UNECE Recommendations[^3] "Internally
    Displaced Persons (IDPs) are defined as nationals or citizens who
    were 'forced migrants' within their country of residence together
    with their dependents living in the same household at the census
    reference time, including children born after the forced migration
    took place". This differs from these recommendations, as family
    members who were not themselves displaced are not treated as IDPs,
    although children with at least one IDP parent are allocated to the
    category 'IDP-related'.

#### Country Examples of Census Questions for Identifying Refugees and IDPs {#a.3.-country-examples-of-census-questions-for-identifying-refugees-and-idps .ListParagraph}

100. Many countries have already taken steps towards identifying
    refugees. In the 2010 census round, there were 14 countries that
    asked questions on residents' status, including refugee status.
    Details of the types on questions asked can be found in *Table 2.15:
    Refugee questions in selected censuses of population and housing*
    below, and in Table 4.1 in IRRS.

-   Morocco and Algeria had special questionnaires for their nomadic
    population.

-   35 countries asked the question 'reason for migration' and 14
    countries provided response options referring to "involuntary
    return", or "displacement".

-   Census data from Kenya 2009 census include conventional households,
    unconventional households (i.e. group quarters and those included in
    special populations), and households in refugee camps.

-   Bosnia and Herzegovina (see Case Study Part II of this Manual,
    paragraph 546) includes questions about citizenship, displacement
    and return. It asks about residence at the time of the 1991 census
    which took place a year before the armed conflict in the country.

-   Cameroon collected information on refugees and IDPs in its fourth
    General census of Population and Housing (see Case Study Part II of
    this Manual, paragraph 553 onwards).

-   Georgia during its 2014 General Population Census asks directly
    about IDP or refugee status and asks about previous place or country
    or residence (see Case Study Part II of this Manual, paragraph 579
    onwards).

### Hybrid census techniques {#a.4.-hybrid-census-techniques .ListParagraph}

102. A hybrid census produces population estimates for small areas or
    for uniform, detailed grids in the absence of a traditional national
    census. Hybrid censuses rely on complete counts of population within
    small, defined areas, through 'micro-census surveys' selected across
    an area. These data are collected relatively rapidly and at a
    fraction of the cost of a full national census. Statistical models
    are then used to link these micro-census data to spatial data with
    full coverage to predict population numbers in the unsampled
    locations. Population totals can also be produced for administrative
    units or for the national level by aggregating these high-resolution
    predictions.

103. This approach can never replace the data generated by a traditional
    population and housing census, which provides full coverage of data
    on individuals, families, households and communities. However, where
    a traditional census cannot be fully executed in all locations of a
    country due to insecurity or other concerns, then this hybrid
    approach can produce population estimates for small areas in the
    absence of traditional census data.

104. Population data for a sample of areas across the area or country
    are needed as a primary input for a hybrid census. These data may
    come from a partial census, a census-like population survey or a
    specifically designed micro-census survey. Robust geo-referencing of
    the geographical areas where population data has been acquired is
    also a requirement.

105. The design must capture the range of population densities,
    demographics and environmental dimensions that exist across the
    area. Enumeration can be conducted within administrative units or
    within other arbitrarily designed polygons, as long as the
    population data is explicitly linked to the correct geographical
    area. Global Positioning Systems (GPS) can be used to ensure
    enumeration is occurring in the correct location, and the inclusion
    of GPS technology in smart phones and tablet computers can integrate
    navigation and the recording of geographical coordinates into
    enumeration activities, minimising locational error and human
    effort. Depending on the questions included in the micro-census,
    disaggregation for certain population groups can be achieved.

106. There are several limitations to the approach:

    20. Micro-census data must be collected with the same care and rigor
        as a full census.

    21. Population data are highly political and contentious, affecting
        all per capita rate estimates, shifting political representation
        and changing claims to power or resources. Conflicts,
        environmental hazards, or large population displacements make it
        difficult to accurately collect information on the dynamic
        population, and misrepresenting populations at risk should be
        avoided.

Box 2.2: Afghanistan hybrid census

>  The last population census in Afghanistan was conducted in 1979 and a new census is not foreseen until after 2020. 
>  To fill this gap, UNFPA, Flowminder/WorldPop and the Afghanistan National Statistical Office have worked together to develop an innovative methodology to estimate subnational population counts. 
>  By combining survey, GIS and satellite data into a statistical model to predict numbers in areas where no population data were available, it was possible to generate high resolution maps of population estimates disaggregated by age and sex, together with uncertainty metrics. The data will be used to support decision making and the measurement of the 98 SDG indicators that require population data. The collaboration has also contributed to further strengthening capacities of the Central Statistics Office and other related government agencies to generate population estimates based on the integration of geospatial data and ground surveys.


### Design Frame


#### Dynamic population mapping {#a.-dynamic-population-mapping .ListParagraph}

107. In order to ensure coverage of refugee and IDP population in a
    census it is essential to have an image of the places where the
    people of interest, the refuges and/or IDPs are currently
    concentrated as mapping exercises can become outdated very quickly
    in times of displacement. A very useful method is to collect data
    from mobile phones using call connection records. From there we can
    have up to date information about sudden changes of population
    density in small areas. With this method it is possible to have also
    a picture for the size of the new refugee or IDP settlement which
    can help in planning census operations.

### Design Processing and Analysis


#### Quality Assessment -- the Post Enumeration Survey {#a.1.-quality-assessment-the-post-enumeration-survey .ListParagraph}

108. Assessing the quality of population and housing census data is an
    integral part of the census operation. UNFPA advocates for more
    countries to carry out some sort of quality assessment exercise. The
    Post Enumeration Survey (PES) of a Population Census is a sample
    survey that evaluates the results of the Census with regard to
    potential underestimation or overestimation of the size of the
    permanent population as well as to the capturing of the
    characteristics of the population.

109. Of the 134 countries or territories responding to a UN Statistics
    Division (UNSD) questionnaire on census implementation in the 2010
    census round, 89 had conducted a PES to evaluate the coverage of the
    census; among them 75% used the PES to evaluate content errors. In
    Africa, Asia and South America, 78% of countries undertook a PES,
    compared to only 40% of countries in Oceania. One third of the
    countries implementing a PES used the results to adjust census
    figures.

110. Any census Post Enumeration Survey should look at the coverage of
    refugees and IDPs and the accuracy of data collected about them. To
    do this it is essential to carry out the PES in refugee camps,
    shelters, rented homes or any other institutional or other places
    where refugees and IDPs may be staying. Special attention must be
    paid for the demographic characteristics and the refugee status of
    the persons concerned. This may need a special design component
    within the PES

111. Such assessments need to consider two kinds of quality measures,
    namely:

    22. Census coverage: This is the percentage of actual
        population/households enumerated. The most common problem is
        under-coverage. Although with populations on the move
        over-coverage is also possible. Over-coverage also happens, if
        local authorities, with an interest in exaggerating their
        populations, are able to influence the data collection. An
        aggregate undercount of 3 to 6% is considered acceptable, but
        some population groups tend to be disproportionately affected,
        e.g. children under low age, young mobile men and undocumented
        migrants.

    23. Content errors: This is the extent of incorrect answers for some
        key variables. Individual data are often provided by an
        informant (the head of household or other adult household
        member) who may not know all the details regarding each person.
        The household members themselves may be unsure or misunderstand
        the question. They may also hide or distort information on
        purpose. As a result, data quality may be poor, despite
        excellent coverage.

112. There are several methods for quality assessment. Content errors
    can often be detected through internal consistency analysis.
    Inconsistencies (e.g. between children's ages and educational
    status, or young girls' ages and number of children, etc.) indicate
    poor data quality. But not all errors lead to inconsistencies.

#### PES Design {#a.2.-pes-design .ListParagraph}

113. Depending on the design of the PES sample, the household
    identification can be more or less rigorous. The following designs
    can be considered:

    i.  The PES sample consists of census enumeration areas that are
        completely re-enumerated in the PES. This design requires
        sufficient cases to provide results for relevant sub-samples
        including displaced people). It is easier to administer than the
        other options and reduces the travel time taken by enumerators.
        There are several requirements for this kind of PES; the
        enumeration areas must be well defined, with explicit
        geographical boundaries, based on good census cartography;
        out-of-area enumeration in the census should be almost
        non-existent; and the interval between the census and the PES
        should be very short (1-3 months).

    ii. The PES sample consists of a larger number of census enumeration
        areas in each of which a certain fraction of households is
        sampled.

    iii. The PES sample contains no clusters, but simply re-enumerates
        every n-th household from a newly produced national household
        listing. This design is efficient from a sampling viewpoint, but
        it is difficult to administer.

114. To apply designs ii) or iii) it is essential to use a rigorous
    household identification system. In its absence, design i) is the
    only viable option and even this may be challenging if the
    conditions listed above are not satisfied.

#### PES Analysis {#a.3.-pes-analysis .ListParagraph}

115. A specific subject that requires planning and attention is how to
    deal with any changes in the situation of the households, that could
    be as a result of forced displacement. This displacement may have
    occurred between the census and the PES, and may impact on the
    household's composition. Specific questions have to be included in
    the PES that allow the detection of such changes, taking either the
    census or the PES as a base line. If the PES is taken as a base
    line, a code has to be included for each household member to
    indicate whether (s)he:

    i.  Was also present in this household and dwelling at census time;

    ii. Was temporarily absent from the household and dwelling at census
        > time;

    iii. Was born after the census; or

    iv. Resided in a different household and dwelling at the time of the
        > census.

116. Note that iv) also includes the situation in which the entire
    household has moved from one physical dwelling to another. In
    cases ii) and iv), it may be wise to ask if the person was
    enumerated at the place where he or she spent census night. In
    addition, it must be verified if any residents at the census time
    have:

    i.  Died since then; or

    ii. Become residents of a different household and dwelling since
        > then.

117. If the census is taken as a base line, the entire PES questionnaire
    has to be filled out according to the situation at census time and
    any changes have to be justified in terms of births, deaths and
    migrations, or changes of physical dwelling.

118. Although the number of changes should be small, especially if the
    PES is carried out very soon after the census, correctly classifying
    them can be time-consuming, especially if the information is found
    to be inconsistent at the time of matching. Take the case of a
    household member who is declared in the PES as having been
    temporarily absent from the household at census time, but who is
    present in the household at the time of the PES (alternative ii).
    The following possibilities exist:

    i.  The person was declared as member of the household at census
        time and the census was organized according to the de jure
        criterion. This would be correct. The best practice (which is
        not attainable in countries without well-defined postal
        addresses) is to verify the census records of the place where
        this person was at census time to check if (s)he was enumerated
        there, to detect any potential double counting.

    ii. The person was declared as member of the household at census
        time and the census was de facto. This would be wrong. If the
        person was also enumerated at the place where (s)he spent census
        night, it would be a case of double counting. If not, it would
        be a classification error.

    iii. The person was not declared as a household member at census
        time and the census was organized according to the de jure
        criterion. Depending on the person's enumeration status in the
        place where (s)he was at census time, it would be a
        classification error or an omission.

    iv. The person was not declared as a household member at census time
        and the census was de facto. This would be correct. But in this
        case, it would be particularly important to verify if (s)he was
        enumerated elsewhere.

119. Deciding whether a person was enumerated elsewhere in the census
    also arises if the person permanently resided elsewhere at census
    time. The best information obtainable in this case may be based on
    his/her answer to the question, but verification may be impossible
    in all but the most sophisticated PES operations.

120. A slightly different situation presents itself in the case of
    persons who moved out of the household and dwelling after the
    census. In theory the PES should try to locate these individuals, to
    obtain their answers to the PES, to compare it to the census.
    Countries with a long history and high level of technical expertise
    in PES execution, such as Australia, actually collect this
    information. But in the PES processes of most developing countries
    this is impossible, and one has to assume that the PES data of such
    persons coincide with what they declared in the census.

Data Source B: Sample Surveys
-----------------------------

### Design Collection


121. This section includes recommended modules and modes of collecting
    data from probability samples, most often household surveys. The
    type and cause of displacement should be considered in designing a
    survey. This section covers additional questions which could be
    added to existing household surveys in order to identify the
    displaced, and a displacement module which could be added to surveys
    to collect information specifically about the displaced.

#### Refugee questionnaires and methodology {#b.1.-refugee-questionnaires-and-methodology .ListParagraph}

122. There are several examples of methodologies for collecting refugee
    statistics from household surveys. There are two possible
    methodologies, the first is to design a specialist refugee survey,
    which could be part of a migrant survey and example of this is the

    survey](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/european-neighbourhood-policy/enp-south/med-hims)
    (see also Case Study in Part II of this Manual) designed for
    Mediterranean countries; the second is to include refugee screening
    questions in a more general household survey such as a Labour Force
    or Living Conditions Survey. The [European Union Labour Force Survey
    had a special module in
    2014](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/1978984/6037334/Model-questionnaire-LFS-AHM-2014.pdf)
    designed to collect data on the labour market situation of migrants
    and their descendants and includes questions to identify and
    describe the situation of refugees and asylum seekers. It asks if
    respondents migrated as a *refugee or seeking international
    protection* in the previous 10 years and about obstacles to
    participating and integrating in the labour market.

123. Where data on stocks and flows, and comparisons with the living
    conditions of other groups in the population are required, then
    screening questions on a regular survey may be the most
    cost-effective methodology. This will depend on the incidence and
    distribution of the refugee and refugee-related population in the
    country and will require the input of a specialist sampling expert
    to determine if adequate samples of the target population of refuges
    are likely to be obtained.

124. Where detailed information about refugees and related populations
    is required, then a specialist survey may be the preferred option,
    but this likely to expensive and carried out rather infrequently. It
    also depends on having a good quality sampling frame from which to
    draw the sample.

Box 2.3: Jordan: The living conditions of Syrian refugees in Jordan:
Results from the 2017-2018 survey of Syrian refugees inside and outside
camps

>  Drawing on a survey implemented by the Department of Statistics (DoS) between November 2017 and January 2018, the report presents recent statistics on Syrian refugees residing in Jordan. It presents findings for six geographic localities: Amman; Zarqa; Irbid; Mafraq; the other governorates taken together; and the refugee camps.
  
>  The report is based on information from 7,632 households and 40,950 individuals. Sampling was based on the DoS sampling frame constructed on the 2015 population census. A total of 1,121 clusters (locations) outside camps and 82 clusters inside camps were randomly selected. The sampling design was not geared towards estimating the number of Syrian refugees in the Hashemite Kingdom, but instead aimed for efficiency with regard to describing the Syrian refugee population in accordance with project objectives.
  
>  A household is defined as a unit that pools its resources together, and whose members usually sleep and eat (most meals) together. Usually, the household members are immediate or more distant relatives, but they do not have to be related. This report defines a refugee household as one where the head of household is a Syrian refugee. It understands a Syrian refugee to be any Syrian individual who fled to Jordan from Syria as a consequence of the crisis and war there and arrived in Jordan after 15 March 2011, and who acknowledges or defines him- or herself as a refugee; any Syrian national who resided in Jordan before 15 March 2011 and became a refugee because he or she could not return to Syria; or any children of these two categories of people born after 15 March 2011. The vast majority of these self-ascribed Syrian refugees, 97 per cent, have formalized their refugee status by registering with the UNHCR.

#### IDP Survey questionnaires {#b.2.-idp-survey-questionnaires .ListParagraph}

125. IRIS, 2020 recommends adding a set of screening questions to
    national household surveys similar to those recommended for
    population census (see paragraph 94 to 95) where the sample design
    is suitable for obtaining reliable estimates. It also advises that
    camps, reception centres, informal settlements and other
    institutional accommodation should be included in the sampling
    frame. Suitable questioning will be developed and included in future
    editions of this Manual.

126. To measure IDPs' living conditions globally, and particularly
    whether they have overcome key displacement related vulnerabilities,
    a core module will be developed and proposed as a standard approach
    for periodic use in existing national multi-topic household surveys
    such as the Living Standards Measurement Survey (LSMS), Demographic
    Health Survey (DHS), Multiple Indicators Cluster Surveys (MICS) or
    other multi-purpose surveys.

127. In order to maximize the quality, utility and comparability of data
    collected globally, it is recommended that the model questionnaire
    to be recommended is used to develop, design and test national
    survey instruments, particularly related to questions on key
    displacement related vulnerabilities. Maintaining consistency in
    questions over time also allows for the creation of time-series for
    IDP statistics.

128. There is some recent research work on methodologies improving the
    estimates of consumption obtained from displaced households and
    avoiding misreporting.

"Indeed, survey respondents in IDP camps may believe that their
responses will influence the provision of humanitarian aid and will thus
misreport consumption in an attempt to influence its distribution. If
survey respondents are underreporting, the inaccuracies generated in the
data are highly problematic. At best, it makes the data spurious and
unusable. At worst, it could lead to misallocations of aid, from more
vulnerable areas to less vulnerable areas, or from solutions emphasizing
sustainability to immediate relief when immediate relief is unnecessary.
Given this context, light touch adaptations to the design of the survey
that prime the idea of honesty offer to make big improvements to the
quality of the data and support provisions the data informs.[^4]

### Design Frame


"This only applies to processes which involve data collection based on
sampling, such as statistical surveys. It identifies and specifies the
population of interest, defines a sampling frame (and, where necessary,
the register from which it is derived), and determines the most
appropriate sampling criteria and methodology (which could include
complete enumeration).

Common sources for a sampling frame are administrative and statistical
registers, censuses and information from other sample surveys. This
sub-process describes how these sources can be combined if needed.
Analysis of whether the frame covers the target population should be
performed. A sampling plan should be made: The actual sample is created
in sub-process 4.1 (Create frame and select sample), using the
methodology, specified in this sub-process". (UNECE, 2013)

#### Sampling Frames {#b.1.-sampling-frames .ListParagraph}

131. A sample is a subset of units drawn from the target population of
    interest. It is not usually convenient, efficient or possible to
    examine every member of an entire population. Sampling reduces the
    resources needed and, if done properly, provides estimates of the
    population characteristics with known accuracy. Sampling is the
    process of selecting units (e.g., households or individuals) from a
    population of interest so that by studying the sample we may
    generalize our results back to the population from which units were
    selected.

132. Sampling design describes how the final sampling units are selected
    and reached for the study. It is determined by the substantive goals
    of the study, and by resource and logistical constraints. There are
    different forms of designs in sampling.

133. Probability-based sampling ensures that every unit in the
    population has a known chance (greater than zero) of being selected
    in the sample, and its probability of selection can be accurately
    determined. This makes it possible to produce unbiased estimates of
    population totals, by weighting sampled units according to their
    probability of selection.

134. Non-probability-based sampling is any sampling method where we do
    not know the chance respondents have to be selected to the sample.
    In most cases some elements of the population have no chance of
    selection because the sampling strategy is based on decisions
    related to convenience, quotas or deliberate choice of elements of
    the population. In these cases, the probability of selection cannot
    be determined. Because the selection of elements is non-random,
    non-probability-based sampling does not allow the estimation of
    sampling errors, and it is not possible to assume that biases cancel
    each other out. When using non-probability based sampling the
    ability of making inferences about the population is limited, and
    the information generated needs to be treated carefully. Some
    adaptations of non-probability-based sampling have been made to
    allow for limited inferences. An example of this is
    Respondent-Driven Sampling, (RDS) or Snowball Sampling that propose
    ways of estimating weights to try to account for biases. See the
    example below from Turkey of a two-stage sampling methodology
    combining spatial and respondent driven sampling.

135. There are sampling constraints which should be considered when
    designing a sample survey of displaced persons. Displaced people may
    be a small proportion of the population, and it is likely that they
    live in specific locations and are not evenly distributed around the
    country or region. Any sample must be of a sufficient size and
    design to yield reliable results. Each survey has its own sampling
    design, even if it is similar from most national household surveys.
    Using the sampling design for an existing national survey will
    introduce a selection bias, if it is not amended to take account of
    the living circumstances of displaced people. Refugees and IDPs can
    live either in camps specially designated for displaced people or
    they can live in houses among the general population, either as part
    of another household or as an independent household.

136. In Somalia where security considerations prevented the usual
    sampling techniques to be carried out an innovative technique was
    used[^5], (see ^Utz\ Pape\ and\ Philip\ Wollburg^)^.^ To address
    security concerns, the Somalia High Frequency Survey adapted
    logistical arrangements, sampling strategy, and questionnaire design
    to limit time on the ground. In logistical arrangements, a detailed
    and timely security assessment ensured that the enumeration areas
    to‐be‐visited were safe on the day of fieldwork. The fieldwork
    protocol was designed such that teams would spend as little time as
    possible in any given region and draw little attention, ensuring
    enumerator and respondent safety. Concerning sampling strategy, it
    was not feasible to conduct a full listing of all households in an
    enumeration area, as this was too time‐intensive and may have raised
    suspicion. Instead, a micro‐listing approach was used, which
    required enumeration areas to be segmented into smaller enumeration
    blocks using satellite imagery. Enumeration blocks are small enough
    for enumerators to list and select households immediately before
    conducting the interview. (see also paragraph 350 and The High
    Frequency Survey in South Sudan[^6] also described in Part II of
    this Manual - South Sudan).

Box 2.4: Turkey example: Two-Stage Sampling Methodology Combining
Spatial Survey and Respondent-Driven (Snowball) Sampling

>  Context: WFP was interested in a vulnerability assessment of the refugee population in Turkey.
>  Challenge: Difficult to identify population (in this case, unregistered refugees), that are likely not randomly distributed geographically and have no comprehensive sampling frame.
>  Methodology: The study used a two-stage sampling methodology. 
>  The first stage was a Simple Spatial Survey Method (S3M) that sought to select settlements evenly (rather than randomly) across Turkey’s geography. Using R’s spatial-sampler function, the researchers superimposed a hexagonal grid over the country, and then selected the refugee settlement that was closest to the nodes of the grid. It also stratified by urban/rural sites, although this stratification was later abandoned due to difficulty of reaching rural respondents. This grid-based sampling method lacks the benefits of true randomness but is acceptable if there is a belief that there are significant differences in geography that might not be adequately captured by a random sample. 
>  The second stage was Respondent-Driven Sampling, which combined a snowball sample and probability weighting based on network theory. First researchers selected 2-3 seed households close to each of the geographic points (seeds) selected by the S3M model. The seed households were selected based on having strong social networks and willingness to participate, but researchers also tried to select households of different ages, genders, aid eligibility, and socioeconomic status. While this likely resulted in a more diverse set of initial households, if this stratification was conducted by field researchers in an ad hoc manner it may have unwittingly biased the sample. The researchers then used a snowball sampling method – after interviewing the first round of seed households, they asked each household to identify 2-3 additional refugee households who they could speak to. This process repeated at each subsequent step until the researchers had selected 25 respondent households from each seed. Based on the original 52 sampling sites, this generated a sample size of approximately 1,300 households. 
>  Researchers then used the RDSAT application to analyse information about the respondent’s social network in order to generate an individual weighting value for each respondent that adjusts for their likelihood of being selected. This weighting process uses network theory to adjust for the non-random nature of the households who are more likely to be selected by this sampling method, and to arrive at a post-weighting sample that should be more representative of the general population. Analysis can then be performed on the post-weighting sample.
>  Conclusion: While this methodology can be used in situations in which there is no available frame and populations are hidden, it has several sources of bias that make it inferior to true probability sampling. For instance, there is a tendency for respondents to refer households who are similar to them in non-representative ways (e.g. select households from the same ethnic group). While the RDS application can help correct for some of this bias, it is important to ensure that the original seeds are representative of the population in a rigorous manner, and that this method not be used when more comprehensive sampling frames are available. 


Box 2.5: Enumeration and Profiling of IDPs, refugees and migrants in
Hargeisa, Somaliland (December 2015)

>  Context: Somaliland had developed a policy framework on internal displacement in 2014, but still needed comprehensive and reliable data in order to inform its implementation by stakeholders. 
>  Challenge: Study was starting from a very low-information baseline, and had difficulties getting access to a representative sample of the population due to resistance within the camp populations and the dispersed nature of the urban population. 
  Methodology:
>  Given the dearth of information available to researchers at the start of the study, the first stage of sampling was to develop a credible map of the population in the various settlements through information-gathering meetings with community focal points (imams, elders, teachers, community organizations). The next stage, enumeration, sought to reach all households in the camps with a brief 12-question census to establish membership to person of concern group (IDPs from Somaliland, Refugee returnees, Economic migrants, etc.). This census succeeded in reaching nearly 12-thousand households, and provided them each with a barcode that, along with phone numbers, was later used for randomization. Thus, the listing exercise resulted in multiple sampling frames of household as the final sampling units for the different populations of concern.
>  From the enumerated list of 11,962 households, 2,510 were selected to be surveyed. The randomization was stratified by person of concern category, so that the selected sample was proportionate to the population totals. Non-probabilistic sampling was applied to groups that did not have a population size large enough to support randomization (asylum seekers and IDPs from South Central Somalia). 
>  As a result of the population size of some groups being small, as mentioned in the previous paragraph, the study also used non-probabilistic snowball sampling methods for the IDPs from South Central Somalia who lived in urban areas outside the camp, asking each respondent to refer additional households for the study. Due to the non-random nature of this selection mechanism, this cannot be considered a representative sample, although it may give a qualitative sense of overall IDP sentiments. 
>  Limitations: 
>  Due to community resistance to being categorized as IDPs, the enumeration stage was asked to conclude before it was able to reach all households living in the settlements. Thus there is a disconnect between the sample frame and the population of interest. There were also challenges with accessing refugees and asylum seekers directly – many declined to be interviewed, and others had had their enumeration barcodes taken by their landlords. While both of these elements contribute to a higher risk of bias within the sample, they speak more to the logistical difficulties inherent in working with IDP and refugee populations rather than any avoidable methodological problem with the study design. All possible mitigation steps should be taken to avoid these types of issues, but only if they can be addressed without jeopardizing the safety of researchers, the well-being of respondents, and the goodwill of communities. 
>  There were also some challenges identifying the categories that were most appropriate for households, particularly between economic migrants and IDPs. If possible, it is important to establish clear and consistent guidelines whenever a categorization methodology is to be used. 




137. Several types of frames could be considered:

i.  Using list of displaced people drawn from administrative sources.

ii. Those drawn from a population census, a surveys or satellite
    imagery, or a combination of all three.

iii. Those drawn from operational data sources such as the Displacement
    Tracking Matrix (IOM-DTM) (e.g. "Comprehensive Food Security and
    Vulnerabilities Analysis" (CFSVA) 2016 in Kurdistan Region of Iraq.

iv. Innovative sampling methodology (e.g. example above of Turkey
    Two-Stage Sampling Method applied by WFP for a study of their
    Emergency Social Safety Net programme in 2018[^7]).

<!-- -->

138. The selection of a sampling methodology depends on a number of
    factors:

    24. The type of population to be covered and their mobility within
        the population. IDPs are usually more mobile and often not
        registered with the authorities, versus refugees who are likely
        to more stable and often registered with the authorities once an
        application for asylum has be made and processed.

    25. Their living arrangements, those living in camps will be easier
        to find, versus those living outside of camp, and where these
        are located.

    26. The temporal aspect of displacement event (recent versus
        protracted).

    27. Size of displacement population in comparison to resident
        population.

139. The geographical scope and characteristics of the target population
    should be determined. This involves describing where the members of
    the target population are located, defining the boundaries of the
    area they are in (e.g. administrative or natural boundaries), and,
    if relevant to the study, adding any other information that
    characterises the physical space of the target population such as
    natural hazards or political situation.

140. The target population should further be narrowed down by
    determining what differentiates them from the general resident
    population of the study area (unless of course the latter is the
    target population). This can for example be descriptions such as
    "IDPs in urban settings in Colombia" or "refugees living in a camp".
    Vulnerabilities, specific age groups, socio-economic
    characteristics, displacement status and legal immigration status
    are examples for such a description.

141. Especially in a volatile and fast-changing setting like forced
    displacement, a clear definition of the time frame or point in time
    covered by the study with respect to the target population is
    important in order to develop a well-defined sampling scheme.

###  {#section-2 .ListParagraph}

### Challenges in defining the target population and constructing a sampling frame and sample size {#b.2.-challenges-in-defining-the-target-population-and-constructing-a-sampling-frame-and-sample-size .ListParagraph}

142. **Ineligibles**: Ineligibles are elements of the general population
    who are not part of the target population of the study. These may be
    non-IDPs who are erroneously selected in a sample of IDPs.

143. **Inaccuracies**: Sampling frames obtained from previous surveys,
    censuses or administrative data might contain outdated information.
    For example, when using 5-year old census data of urban and rural
    areas to draw a representative sample of the population, we need to
    carefully assess whether population growth rates have been different
    for rural and urban areas during these 5 years, or whether there
    have been large population movements caused by displacements. If
    there have been more people have been moving from the countryside to
    cities than the other way around, but our sampling frame does not
    account for it, then using the old census data would lead to
    under-sampling of urban areas.

144. **Missing information**: In the context of forced displacement, it
    can be difficult to obtain information to define target population
    and construct sampling frames, especially for unregistered
    out-of-camp populations. In such situations, alternative information
    sources should be considered. These could include but are not
    limited to; previous studies, scoping exercises, qualitative
    assessments, key information interviews, desk review,
    community-based methods to build sampling frames.

145. **Multiple listing**: Multiple listing denotes the situation where
    a final sampling unit such as a household gets listed more than once
    in the sampling frame. This can be a problem for example in
    respondent-driven non-probability sampling frames where listed
    households are asked if they know of other households that fit the
    target population. One household can easily be mentioned more than
    once. Sampling frames need to be carefully assessed and cleaned to
    ensure no final sampling unit appears more than once.

Data Source C: Administrative Data Including Population Registers
-----------------------------------------------------------------

### Design Collection


146. There are several potential sources of non-survey data on displaced
    people, the first is national population registers, the second is
    administrative data maintained by governments for the purpose of
    administering a range of services, controlling migration or issuing
    documentation, and the third is operational data kept by
    humanitarian agencies and governments for the purposes of supporting
    displaced people. This section gives examples of population
    registers, supplemented administrative records; and describes the
    operational data maintained by UNHCR about displaced populations and
    the way it is used.

147. Eurostat, in its Reference and Management of Nomenclatures system
    (RAMON) defines administrative data as a **"**Database which is
    updated continuously (often for administrative purposes, such as
    population registers or building registers) and from which
    statistics can be extracted / aggregated / computed".[^8]

148. Administrative data are a useful source of information for
    measuring both the stock of displaced populations, and potentially
    the flows. If they include variables allowing the identification of
    the target population, or if the specific administrative source can
    be linked at the individual level to another data source such as
    another register, a survey or a census, then they provide potential
    for integrating a number of sources (See next section Data Source D:
    Integrated Data). This can potentially be a rich source of
    statistics.

149. Very diverse types of primary administrative data may be of
    interest from a statistical point of view, these include:

    28. Specific registers maintained by administrations or
        organisations responsible for refugees and IDPs (including
        registration of displaced people in camps and/or elsewhere).

    29. Databases maintained by humanitarian organisations supporting
        refuges in informal settlements. These are often linked to the
        beneficiaries accessing displacement specific services and
        benefits.

    30. General population registers of the total resident population of
        a country and/or registers of foreign citizens.

    31. Other administrative registers (residence permit registers, tax
        registers, social security registers, register of border
        crossings etc.).

150. Such administrative registers are, in particular, the main data
    source for statistics on asylum applicants and decisions taken
    during the asylum application process in regions such as Europe and
    Northern America. In the EU and in some additional neighbouring
    countries, they are also the main source of statistics on the number
    of refugees living in the country through specific sub-categories of
    reasons to stay in the residence permits statistics (refugees legal
    status, subsidiary protection, humanitarian reasons) and statistics
    on persons who are the subject of pending applications for
    international protection (asylum seekers whose application is still
    being examined).

151. In many countries without the current capacity to maintain
    administrative registers, UNHCR maintains registers on behalf of the
    government until the necessary capacity is developed. Arrangements
    can be made for accessing these registers for statistical purposes.

152. A number of countries keep population registers, and several
    examples of these are described in this manual. The United Nations'
    *Recommendations on Statistics on International Migration Revision
    1* (1998) provides useful guidance for utilising administrative data
    sources for migration statistics in general, and refugee statistics
    in particular. These recommendations can be adapted for IDP
    registers, however IDPs are often not included, and if they are then
    they may not be identifiable as IDPs because their movements have
    not been captured.

153. According to these recommendations, two types of administrative
    sources should be considered for the collection of migration
    statistics:

    32. Administrative registers, defined as "a data system providing
        for the continuous recording of selected information pertaining
        to each member of the target population" and including
        "population registers, registers of foreigners and other special
        type of registers covering particular groups of persons, such as
        registers of asylum seekers" (United Nations, 1998, p. 17).

    33. Other administrative sources derived "from the operation of
        administrative procedures designed to control international
        migration" including sources related to "the issuance of
        residence permits", "the issuance of work permits",
        "applications for asylum", "tax or social security", and "border
        collections" (United Nations, 1998, pp. 20, 23).

154. To be useful for IDP statistics the system must be accessible to
    those who have been displaced and be regularly updated to reflect
    recent movements, changes of circumstances and to reflect flows in
    the stock by either adding new cases or removing those who have
    exited from the stock.

155. For refugees and refugee related populations asylum seekers are
    often not treated as part of the usually resident population and are
    therefore omitted from the population register. Registers of asylum
    seekers or foreigners may also be required to complete the
    statistical estimates, (see Part II of this Manual: Hungary see
    para. 589, and Turkey Case Studies see para. 630 and 654.

156. The use of "registers of asylum seekers" is specifically
    recommended for estimating the stock of asylum seekers (by length of
    stay in the country) and the number of new asylum applications
    within a given year (United Nations, 1998, p. 19), and for producing
    statistics on the outcome of the asylum procedure.

157. Two types of units are used to record applications, "cases or
    applications" and "persons \[covered by these cases or
    applications\]" and consequently to be registered.

#### Population Registers {#c.1.-population-registers .ListParagraph}

158. Part 2 of this Manual provides a number of Case Studies, and
    several case studies of Population Registers as the basis for
    displacement statistics are described briefly below, more
    information can be found in Part II.

##### Hungary (see Part II Hungary)

159. In Hungary both the National Directorate-General For Aliens
    Policing (NDGAP) and the Hungarian Central Statistical Office (HCSO)
    publish official statistics on persons involved in forced migration.
    National Directorate-General for Aliens Policing (NDGAP) is the
    authority which is responsible for the asylum procedure in Hungary.
    The NDGAP produces statistics on the asylum procedure, on numbers of
    persons taken under international protection status (refugees under
    the Geneva Convention and persons taken under subsidiary protection)
    and the figures of the persons who receive national humanitarian
    status (persons who are taken under the principle of non-
    refoulement).

160. The NDGAP decides on the asylum applications[^9], recognising
    refugees under the Geneva Convention and persons who are under
    subsidiary protection. Data is forwarded to the Ministry of Interior
    which runs the Population and Address Register (PAR). In Hungary the
    persons taken under international protection are issued with an
    identity card (and have similar rights to Hungarian citizens) and
    therefore their data is stored in the population register.

161. In contrast to asylum seekers who are not considered to be part of
    the usually resident population and are not included on the PAR,
    refugees and subsidiary protected persons are part of the usual
    residence population in Hungary and included in the PAR.

162. The Hungarian Central Statistics Office (HCSO) receives the
    aggregated statistical data on asylum applicants from the NDGAP on a
    monthly basis and the aggregated data on positive decisions
    (refugees, subsidiary protected, and persons taken under subsidiary
    protection) on a quarter-year basis.

##### Norway (see also Part II Norway)

163. Refugee statistics in Norway are produced from administrative data.
    All asylum seekers must register with the Norwegian immigration
    authorities, and their case data and personal data are stored in a
    database maintained by the Norwegian Directorate of Immigration
    (UDI). The database contains data on UN convention refugees as well
    as refugees who enter Norway on their own and apply for asylum.

164. The UDI statistics division has access to copies of raw data from
    the database and has the ability to extract, aggregate and process
    the data in whatever way it chooses. At the same time, selected
    personal and case data are transferred directly from the case
    processing system to the Central Population Register (CPR), and from
    there transferred to Statistics Norway through daily batch jobs. UDI
    also provides supplemental, processed data to Statistics Norway in a
    data set that is compiled every year. The most important variable in
    this data set is each immigrant's reason for immigration.

165. An obvious [advantage]{.underline} of this system is that the
    producers of official statistics on refugees -- Statistics Norway
    and UDI -- have excellent access to data as well as control of how
    the data is processed, analysed and disseminated.

166. A major [challenge]{.underline} is that data collection first and
    foremost is designed and built for case processing, not to produce
    statistics. Hence, the main purpose of the data collection is to
    facilitate the flow of applications through the administrative
    systems, while keeping track of the applicants' legal status and
    rights. Many people are involved in the handling of each
    application, and the system is built to enable each case handler to
    finish tasks and transfer the case to the next person, through all
    the steps from application to final decision. For this purpose, it
    may not even be necessary to access or collect structured data, as
    many case processing tasks can be resolved simply based on case
    documents.

##### Turkey Refugee Statistics (see Part II Turkey)

167. All addresses within the boundaries of the country were registered
    in the National Address Database (NAD) in 2006, and by linking
    addresses of Turkish citizens living within the boundaries of the
    country with the Turkish identification number, Address Based
    Population Registration System (ABPRS) was established in 2007.
    Subsequently, in order to obtain information which was not available
    in the ABPRS at provincial level, Population and Housing Survey
    (PHS) was conducted using a combined methodology (by linking the
    ABPRS to a large-scale sample survey) in 2011. According to the
    Official Statistics Programme, annual information on population size
    by administrative division (province, district, town, village and
    quarter), and its basic characteristics (age-sex structure, place of
    registration, nationality, literacy and educational attainment,
    legal marital status, place of birth, type of households, and
    internal migration in province level) are produced from ABPRS and
    announced to the public in January of the following year.

168. TurkStat is responsible for producing stock and flow statistics on
    international migration by demographic and other related indicators
    of migrants. For foreigners residing in Turkey, citizenship and
    country of birth statistics are produced from ABPRS. In addition,
    TurkStat produced information on immigration and emigration, namely
    annual migration flow statistics, for the first time based on
    administrative registers in 2018 for the years 2016 and 2017.
    Similar to the statistics on foreign stock population, migration
    flow statistics covering both Turkish citizens and foreigners are
    produced in "country of birth" and "country of citizenship"
    breakdowns (no disaggregation by refugee or refugee like
    populations). In order to obtain the statistics on foreign
    population residing in Turkey, foreign registers held by the General
    Directorate of Civil Registration and Nationality (GDCRN) and the
    residence-work permit registers are mainly used.

169. Along with the Göç-Net (migration management system), registers of
    residence permits, international protection (applications, refugee,
    conditional refugee, subsidiary protection, and temporary protection
    under international protection), illegal migration and other events
    related to foreigners are kept in connection to each other.
    Directorate General of Migration Management (DGMM) is responsible
    for collection, analysis and dissemination of the data on
    international protection, residence permits and irregular migration.

170. Principal variables defined concerning applicants of international
    protection are age, gender, educational status, nationality and
    marital status etc. Statistical figures on international protection
    applications are shared on DGMM's official website and published in
    Annual Migration Reports of DGMM on a yearly basis.

171. With the *"Temporary Protection Regulation"* issued in 2014,
    Syrians seeking international protection were given temporary
    protection status in Turkey. Syrians are granted a foreign
    identification number to benefit from health, education, labour
    market access and social support services. Based on the legal
    (de-jure) population definition, Syrians under temporary protection
    are not covered in the Address Based Population Registration System
    (ABPRS). Thus, this population group is not officially accepted as
    "resident population". Only the Syrians who entered the country
    legally (with the required official documents such as a passport)
    are included in ABPRS population like other foreigners holding a
    residence permit/work permit. Briefly, while approximately 3.5
    million Syrians under temporary protection are not covered in ABPRS,
    the number of Syrians in the ABPRS was just 87,955 as of December
    31, 2018.

172. The number of persons under temporary protection in Turkey was
    14,000 in 2012 reached 225,000 thousand in 2013, 1.5 million in
    2014, 2.5 million in 2015, 3.5 million in 2017 and almost 3.6
    million as of June 2018.

#### Refugee and IDP Registers {#c.2.-refugee-and-idp-registers .ListParagraph}

173. Registration data provides valuable information humanitarian
    agencies about the **overall demographic and other characteristics**
    of the population of concern, including population figures, levels,
    rates, averages and other patterns. When disaggregated, it also
    facilitates the **identification of individuals and groups** for
    support programmes and interventions, for designing, planning,
    targeting, delivering, tracking and monitoring protection and
    assistance interventions. The data is potentially available for
    statistical analysis if the appropriate inter-agency agreements are
    in place (see Phase 1.5. Check Data Availability in this Manual and
    Part II for a specimen 'Agreement on the Transfer of Personal Data
    of Refugees and Asylum-seekers' between UNHCR and a host government)

174. Registration activities can be a major source of population data,
    which are essential for humanitarian agencies programming purposes
    and of universal relevance to the entire humanitarian community.
    This section provides examples of registers maintained by both
    governments and the UNHCR registration system.

##### Bosnia and Herzegovina (see Part II Bosnia and Herzegovina)

175. Statistics on IDPs and refugees are produced by a member of the
    National Statistical System, the Ministry of Human Rights and
    Refugees. This is a state level organisation responsible for
    unifying the data from other entities and districts, and for
    producing statistical reports. The country's municipalities and
    cantons are responsible for collecting the data and for delivering
    it to the Ministry, together with The Ministry of Refugees and DPs
    of the Republika Srpska Entity; and the Government of Brčko District
    B&H, Department of Displaced Persons, Refugees, and Housing.

176. Producing statistics on refugees and IDPs was initiated by the
    government at the beginning of the war in the 1990s. When war ended
    the first comprehensive official registration of persons in B&H was
    carried out in late 2000 by Ministries and local authorities. The
    registration and estimation of the number and the status of
    displaced persons was completed on 31/03/2005.

177. The administrative records in the Database of Displaced Persons
    (DDPR) are the main source of statistics on refugees and IDPs,
    supplemented by census data. Details of the variables found in the
    DDPR can be found in the Part II Case Study, as can the census form
    which included specific questions on persons displaced since 1991.
    These questions include their habitual place of residence place of
    residence and returns and legal status.

##### Colombia (see Part II Colombia)

178. The National Planning Department and the National Department for
    Social Prosperity collect and produce official statistics on the
    country\`s most vulnerable population. These datasets account for
    most of the administrative records used by the Victims\` Unit to
    update socio economic variables of IDPs at an individual level.
    Other relevant datasets are the official education enrolment system,
    the social security system, the registers´ office, the housing and
    agricultural subsidies registers, among others. 

179. The official source to count the stock of IDPs in Colombia is the
    Single Victims\` Registry managed by the Victims\` Unit, a
    government agency responsible for providing assistance and
    reparation to victims of the armed conflict. The Single Victims´
    Registry has been counting IDPs since 1985. At October 2019, 7.5
    million IDPs were registered.  IDP households who wish to be
    included in the Single Victims´ Registry present a declaration
    before the Public Ministry (Ombudsman´s Regional Office,
    Procurator´s Municipal Office).  According to the national
    legislation an IDP has to declare within two years after the event
    of displacement took place. Once an IDP is granted the status of
    victim, they are included in the Single Victims´ Registry. Once
    registered they are entitled to access relevant assistance and
    reparation. 

180. An individual assessment of vulnerability is run twice a year for
    IDPs registered in the Single Victims´ Registry. The data used to
    run the assessment comes from both primary and secondary sources. 
    Primary data is collected through a survey conducted by phone on a
    continuous basis. Secondary data, which is the main source of data,
    involves the exchange of official administrative records with other
    government agencies at both national and local level. Additionally,
    IDPs update their location directly to the Victims´ Unit through
    services points located throughout the country.  

181. There is a Protocol for Information Exchange between the Victims\`
    Unit and all the government agencies which form part of the National
    System for the Assistance and Reparation of Victims. The process of
    information exchange is formalised through a Memorandum of
    Understanding, in compliance with the relevant legislation. 

182. Various statistics can be calculated out of the Single Victims´
    Registry: these are disaggregation by sex, age, ethnicity, type of
    human right violation (displacement, forced disappearance, homicide,
    threat, among others), geographic location or number of victims per
    year.

183. For statistical purposes, an IDP is taken out of the stock when
    they overcome displacement related vulnerabilities.

##### Ukraine (see Part II Ukraine)

184. The Ministry of Social Policy in Ukraine is responsible for
    ensuring the creation and maintenance of a Unified Information
    Database (UIB) on Internally Displaced Persons. Registration of the
    place of residence of the IDP is carried out in accordance with the
    laws of 2014 and 2015. However, the State Statistics Committee of
    Ukraine receives only very aggregated information from the UIB, and
    is unable to use that data in its demographic calculations.

185. In addition, several studies have been made of IDPs in Ukraine.
    Most of them by humanitarian organisations providing assistance to
    IDPs. The studies do not generate official statistics. The
    International Organization for Migration regularly produce
    statistics on IDPs in Ukraine through their National Monitoring
    System, based on their Displacement Tracking Matrix approach. It
    collects and analyses information on the socio-economic
    characteristics of IDPs and IDP households. One challenge the IOM
    faces, is to have an updated sample for their survey.

##### UNHCR Registration Systems (see Part III for more information and Part II for a specimen data sharing agreement between UNHCR and national governments (page 222)

186. Registration data for 'Operational Planning and Programming' is
    required for designing, planning and delivering suitable programmes
    for the population of concern. Registration data analysis
    strengthens the overall operational intelligence for protection and
    solutions, helping to facilitate early identification of protection
    risks and highlights protection gaps as well as target resources for
    the greatest protection impact.

187. **Registration data can only be usefully analysed if the data
    collected at registration is complete, of a good quality and
    regularly updated**. A good registration system should also include
    mechanisms to manage its data, making it reliable and effective for
    planning and programming. There are many reasons why registration
    data may be of poor quality: data entry error, inadequate training
    for staff, ill-designed processes and insufficient oversight,
    cultural misunderstanding or weak standard operating procedures.

188. The personal data of persons of concern must be managed in a
    way that protects confidentiality and is consistent with privacy and
    data protection principles set out in UNHCR's **[Data Protection
    policy](http://www.refworld.org/pdfid/55643c1d4.pdf)[.]{.underline}**
    To this end, data repositories (databases) should be designed so
    that access rights for each content material are determined
    individually per user, based on a "need-to-know" and "need-to-use"
    basis. A framework on the segregation of duties aims to clearly
    define and grant the level of access that corresponds with the
    user's specific role and responsibilities, in line with the [**Data
    Protection policy**](http://www.refworld.org/pdfid/55643c1d4.pdf)
    (para. 4.2) and related
    [**Guidance**](https://www.refworld.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/rwmain?page=search&docid=5b360f4d4&skip=0&query=guidance%20data%20protection%20unhcr)
    (para. 6.3.8).

189. UNHCR's population, Registration and Identity Management Eco-System
    (PRIMES)[^10] contains a Data Port element that uses registration
    data to generate reports, statistics and trends analysis based on
    global aggregate data. The Data Port was developed to maximize the
    potential of the data collected and contribute to global data
    analysis on displacement. The Data Port can be used by UNHCR and
    Partner Users of PRIMES tools; and will eventually be accessible to
    persons of concern as well as others looking for statistics on
    forced displacement. The tool is simple enough to be used by regular
    users and not exclusively technical users.

190. **Registration data also provides the basis for identity management
    during assistance distribution. Individuals** are verified against
    their registration record (biographic and biometric) at the point of
    distribution, and records of those receiving assistance updated
    after each distribution, ensuring accountability and reconciliation.

191. For assistance activities related to food security for persons of
    concern, the [2011 MoU between UNHCR and
    WFP](https://collaborate.unhcr.org/teams/DPSM_IMRS/imrs_docs/_layouts/15/WopiFrame2.aspx?sourcedoc=/teams/DPSM_IMRS/imrs_docs/Shared%20Documents/Assistance/WFP/MoU%20Cash%20Addendum/2011%20Global%20MoU.pdf&action=default),
    complemented by the [Cash Addendum
    (May 2017)](https://www.refworld.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/rwmain?page=search&docid=596f5ef74&skip=0&query=Cash%20Addendum%20unhcr%20WFP)
    the [Joint Principles on Targeting
    (December 2017)](https://www.unhcr.org/protection/health/5ad9e6407/unhcr-wfp-joint-principles-targeting-assistance-meet-food-other-basic-needs.html)
    [ ]{.underline} and the [ ]{.underline} [Data Sharing Addendum
    (September 2018)](https://www.refworld.org/docid/5bbcac014.html)[^11]
    establish areas of cooperation between UNHCR and WFP, namely in the
    areas of preparedness planning, joint assessment of the eligibility
    of refugees and returnees for food assistance, the composition of
    the food basket or cash equivalent and the modality of the
    assistance to be distributed.

192. The Joint Data Centre (JDC), a collaboration between the World Bank
    and UNHCR, supports the alignment of data and information between
    humanitarian and development actors, pursuant to the Global Compact
    on Refugees. It also supports the World Bank's IDA 18 programme,
    which dedicates World Bank grants to refugee populations and their
    host communities.

193. Registration data in proGres is a key source of both population
    data (e.g. aggregate numbers, age, sex and disability
    disaggregation, location) and socio-economic data (e.g. microdata on
    income, consumption, skills, health status, economic activity). When
    complemented with additional socio-economic household surveys and
    assessments, this data can provide UNHCR and its partners, as well
    as the World Bank and its partners, with **demographic and welfare
    information on persons of concern to support tailored programming
    and planning.**

194. UNHCR and the World Bank also collaborate on the anonymization of
    registration data for open data access. Open data access via
    [*UNHCR's Microdata
    Library*](https://microdata.unhcr.org/index.php/home) allows for
    high-quality analysis and research on refugee and other populations
    of concern, including for the purposes of identifying gaps in the
    implementation of services to populations of concern as well as
    informing broader national development and humanitarian planning.

195. The data available in UNHCR registration systems is set out in the
    Table *UNHCR registration data variables* to be found in Part III of
    this Manual.

Data Source D: Integrated Data, Combining Data from Different Sources
---------------------------------------------------------------------

### Design Collection


196. Because of the variety and the varying coverage of the possible
    sources containing statistical information on refugee and internally
    displaced persons (IDPs), data integration is a promising solution
    for improving the quality of refugee and IDPs statistics. Recent
    projects like the UNECE High Level Group for the Modernisation of
    Official Statistics (HLG-MOS) or the Eurostat ESS 2020 vision
    project in the area of data integration witness of the growing
    interest for data integration.

197. In particular, data integration can answer several challenges
    raised when compiling official statistics on refugee and IDPs by:

    34. Improving the coverage of target groups,

    35. Improving data availability, especially socio-economic variables
        related to refugee and IDP populations,

    36. Improving accuracy through the crossing of different sources in
        order to assess refugee and IDP status.

198. The objective of this part of the Manual is to present the main
    steps related to data integration as well as an overview on the
    possible data integration techniques which can help and guide
    practitioners in NSOs interested in applying data integration to
    refugee and IDPs statistics. As far as possible, the provided
    information will be illustrated by existing good practices in NSOs
    and will be completed by more detailed technical information and
    references about the presented methods.

199. This section is an edited version of the full text on data
    integration. A much fuller description of options and techniques can
    be found in Part 3 of this report PART III -- 2D Data Integration
    Techniques.

200. The first step is to clearly define the output objectives of
    integration and to agree this with the providers of the data sources
    to be used. This is followed by a discussion of the several issues
    that NSOs will face if they want to apply data integration
    techniques; these issues relate to the legal environment and data
    protection legislation, the relationships with external data
    providers, the required IT resources and the skills needed. The next
    section addresses issues pertaining to the main sources which could
    be the object of data integration and is followed by the main data
    integration statistical methods. These methods are illustrated by
    examples of good practices. Since any data integration process
    actually covers all the phases of the GSBPM, practitioners and data
    compilers can refer to the other parts of the Compilers' Manual for
    more detailed information on the statistical tasks common to all
    statistical processes, such as the quality assessment or the design
    of the process.

#### Output objectives of data integration {#d.1.-output-objectives-of-data-integration .ListParagraph}

201. *The output objectives of data integration* should be defined at
    the very first stage. The feasibility and quality of the foreseen
    outputs need also to be assessed during this phase. When
    establishing contacts with possible data providers establishing
    outputs has to be undertaken simultaneously, in order to have a
    clear vision and understanding of the data requirements between all
    stakeholders. Among possible output objectives which could be
    achieved through data integration, the following list shows the main
    objectives:

    37. Production of new variables of interest (socio-economic
        variables related to refugees and IDPs)

    38. Improve statistical classification (profiling)

    39. Editing and imputation

    40. Improve the coverage (detection of duplicates, use of
        capture/recapture methods)

    41. Produce geographically very detailed data (integration with GIS)

    42. Improve sampling frame for surveys (Administrative sources, New
        digital sources)

    43. Quality assessment

202. The advantages and limitations of integrating data from different
    sources are set out below in the *Table 2.17: Advantages and
    disadvantages of integrating data from different data sources**.***
    The starting point is the administrative register of individuals, to
    which can be added other data. These other data sources can improve
    quality, add variables and improve coverage and where new digital
    sources are used add geographic and movement details.

#### Data availability, accessibility and other requirements {#d.2.-data-availability-accessibility-and-other-requirements .ListParagraph}

203. The design of the integration methodology constitutes one of the
    main tasks to be realised in data integration. Besides the technical
    tasks, good collaboration with external data providers and other
    involved stakeholders is of high importance when designing the data
    collection, production system and workflows. Very often, the sources
    that are considered for data integration are not under the direct
    responsibility of statistical authorities. The first requirement is
    to ensure the data's availability and accessibility, as well as to
    have in place the capacities to use them (see also Phase 1.5. Check
    Data Availability).

204. This process is obviously strongly dependent on the national
    context, in particular the legal environment as well as the status
    of the various statistical authorities. The following paragraphs
    will describe in more detail the main tasks to achieve taking into
    account the potential national context. Assessment of the points set
    out below should be undertaken at the very first stage and help to
    construct a business plan for data integration.

    *a. Legal environment and data protection legislation*

205. Some countries provide a legal basis for the NSO to access data and
    metadata for all available administrative data sources for
    evaluating their potential use in official statistics. If, based on
    the metadata, the data source is judged to be useful to build new or
    improve existing official statistics, then test data can be
    requested to further assess data quality and to produce prototype
    statistics.

206. A guarantee of data confidentiality, ethical standards, as well as
    the legal environment obliges NSOs to guarantee the confidentiality
    of data, either for dissemination or when sharing data with other
    providers. In particular, NSOs shall avoid direct identification or
    indirect identification of the respondent (statistical unit). Direct
    identification means identification of the respondent from their
    formal identifiers (name, address, identification number), whereas
    indirect identification means inferring a respondent\'s identity by
    a combination of variables or characteristics (e.g. age, gender,
    education etc). Concerning dissemination, statistical disclosure
    control can use methods like tabular data protection for aggregate
    information on respondents presented in tables (use of suppression,
    rounding, randomisation and/or interval publication) and micro-data
    protection (using local suppression, sampling, global recoding, top
    and bottom coding, rounding, rank swapping and micro-aggregation).
    Concerning the storage of data, physical protection guarantee that
    the data is securely stored and not accessible to anyone without
    explicit authorisation. When coming to data integration (micro-data
    sharing with external data providers), the use of anonymisation
    techniques (see also *g. Security environment* discussed below)
    shall guarantee the confidentiality of the data shared.

    *b. Cooperation with external data providers*

207. Political willingness and technical readiness are essential.
    Considerations of data security tend to dominate, and a data sharing
    agreement is a requirement, this should identify the data points to
    be shared, and the modalities of data transfer. The following issues
    are recommended:

    44. Building trust, depoliticizing the discourse.

    45. Define cooperation with data providers and other involved
        stakeholders (administration, NGOs, other) through clear MOUs
        ("data used for this and only this", safeguard of
        confidentiality by statistical authorities). What are the
        precise requirement and limits of use of the data, access to
        micro or macro data?

    46. Undertaking a comprehensive mapping of the systems and of the
        data.

    47. Ownership of the results by statistical authorities.

    48. Presentation to external stakeholders of the foreseen output
        (data to be collected, flows, stocks and other variables to be
        produced, analytical purposes).

    49. Mapping in collaboration with data providers between the
        information contained in various sources and the official
        statistics needs.

    50. Design of the data collection process in cooperation with
        external data providers (including metadata).

    51. Design production systems and workflows in cooperation with
        external data providers (software, connection between various
        stakeholders, IT resources, etc).

    52. Sustainability of the envisaged process.

        *c. IT Resource requirements*

208. Data integration has specific IT requirements which are as follows:

    1.  Necessary software capable of integrating data sources.

    2.  Compatible data format for receiving and sharing data, for
        extraction.

    3.  Secure connections to allow data sharing (VPN, API...).

        *d. Skills needed*

209. In addition to IT data integration needs high level skills which go
    beyond the statistical:

    53. Software architect and engineer to look at integration part.

    54. Database developer to then look at structure.

    55. Data management expert.

    56. Legal advisor.

    57. Statisticians/data scientists for building and implementing
        integration methods.

        *e. Statistical requirements*

210. The availability of unique identifiers (UID) for statistical units
    or the possibility to build them is necessary. These may be obtained
    from:

    58. Population register number.

    59. ID-Card or passport number for IDPs.

    60. Residence permit number for refugees.

    61. Tax or social security numbers.

    62. Operational data: UNHCR asylum seeker and refugee certificates
        registration number.

    63. Building of a synthetic UID based on data matching.

    64. Probabilistic data matching.

    65. Respect of the legislation on data protection.

211. There should be a quality assessment of the chosen data integration
    methods including:

    66. Assessment of the data linkage quality.

    67. Assessment of the estimation quality when integrating various
        data sets.

    68. Assessment of the applicability and relevancy of the chosen
        method.

        Documentation on the methods used in order to guarantee
        transparency and clarity of produced statistics.

*f. Capacity requirements*

212. Data integration requires considerable statistical capacity
    including:

    69. In house skills which vary depending on the adopted systems but
        in general which include data science and statistical modelling
        skills, necessary IT skills to exchange and store data in a
        secure and efficient way, as well as database administration
        skills including data mapping documentation, extraction,
        transformation and load (ETL), database performance tuning for
        load and retrieval of data.

    70. Capacity building.

    71. Costs.

*g. Security environment*

213. When exchanging or sharing data from multiple data providers, this
    process shall be in conformity with the data protection legislation.
    It means in particular that any data exchange is secure, and that
    micro-data confidentiality is respected. In addition,
    confidentiality of data disseminated must also be respected. Secure
    data exchange can be realised through data encryption, whereas
    hashing techniques can be used for ensuring micro-data
    confidentiality. Lastly, confidentiality of data for processing and
    analysis can be done with pseudonymisation techniques. Part III *1.
    Confid*entiality provides a short presentation of data encryption,
    pseudonymisation and anonymisation techniques.

#### Possible sources of data for integration  {#d.3.-possible-sources-of-data-for-integration .ListParagraph}

214. The possible sources for refugee and IDPs statistics are various
    and extensive. Before considering any kind of data integration, a
    review of the possible sources of information should be undertaken.
    This review should focus on checking their availability, defining
    the possible outputs that can be derived through
    combination/integration of several sources as well as assessing the
    quality of those outputs.

215. In the field of statistics on refugee and IDP statistics, an
    indicative list of main possible sources is presented below:

    72. Administrative registers on refugees and IDPs: asylum seekers
        registers (applications), registers on decisions granting
        international protection, resettled persons register, residence
        permits registers, population registers, IDP registers.

    73. Other administrative registers: social and health registers, tax
        registers, social security registers, electricity subscribers,
        etc.

    74. Census.

    75. General population surveys: general sample survey (labour force,
        education, income, living conditions, ...).

    76. Dedicated surveys on refugees and IDPs.

    77. Operational data collected by UNHCR or NGOs, e.g. movement
        tracking systems (Displacement Tracking Matrix).

    78. Geographical Information system (GIS).

    79. New digital sources: Passively collected information from
        satellite images, mobile phones, web-scraping and web-crawling
        of internet platforms or social media content?

\*UID = Unique identification number

216. As the list of possible sources presented in *Table 2.19: Main
    characteristics of potential data sources for integration* shows, a
    unique source does not exist that is capable of drawing a complete
    statistical picture of refugees and IDPs. Either in term of coverage
    or data availability, usually only integration of several sources
    can lead to the production of the necessary statistics for the
    users. Most often, integration of several sources, requires the
    linking of several data sources at the micro-level by using an
    identifier common to all the involved sources. Sometimes, data
    integration can also consist in using several sources at a more
    aggregated level in order to derive the best estimate of a target
    value, in particular the total number of a population. In both
    cases, micro and macro data integration, output objectives of the
    foreseen process must be well defined.

#### Overview on linking several data sources {#d.4.-overview-on-linking-several-data-sources .ListParagraph}

217. One of the main challenges in any data integration project is how
    to establish the link between the different data sets, and the fact
    that those data sources usually have different structures. Depending
    on how the data need to be integrated, this can be generalized into
    2 main categories;

    80. **Data linking (Join):** normally a common variable is required
        in multiple data sets to establish a link. This common variable
        or variables is called a Join Key. It could be one unique
        identifier used in 2 data sets such as a national ID number, or
        it could be set of quasi identifiers that exists in both data
        sets. The figure below illustrates an example of what needs to
        be done to expand the data set horizontally or by adding more
        variables to analysed data set.

generated](media/image21.png){width="3.415277777777778in"
height="2.7402777777777776in"}

81. **Data consolidation (Union, or data alignment):** when data sets
    come from multiple sources and the aim is to create one unified
    dataset with all records. As data sets might have different
    structure and variable scopes, there might be a need to transform
    the variables before adding them to the consolidated dataset. For
    example, in one data set there might be date of birth while the
    target dataset uses the year of birth. In that case one needs to
    transform date of birth before loading the data into the target
    dataset. As under the previous example, one can think of what needs
    to be done to expand the data set vertically or by adding more
    observations to analysed dataset.

generated](media/image22.png){width="2.545138888888889in"
height="2.415277777777778in"}

218. In most projects both are needed i.e. relevant variables have to be
    selected from different data sets and transformed before injecting
    them to target database. This process is known as ETL (Extract,
    Transform, Load).

###  {#section-4 .ListParagraph}


Design, processing and analysis
--------------------------------------

219. This section describes the different tasks required by data
    integration and provides a description and references on the methods
    that could be applied. This part is mainly based on the work done
    within the framework of the ESS Vision 2020 ADMIN (Administrative
    data sources), in particular the one on data integration and
    estimation methods[^12]. Nevertheless, this section shows as far as
    possible how integration and estimation methods could be applied to
    the field of refugee and IDP statistics.

### Data editing and imputation {#d.1.-data-editing-and-imputation .ListParagraph}

220. When using multisource data, inconsistencies at micro level are
    frequently encountered. Integration of data sources at micro-level
    may give rise to composite records that consist of a combination of
    values obtained from several different sources. For instance, a
    register could be combined with values obtained from a survey for
    the same units (obtained by record linkage); or from an integration
    of several surveys with non-overlapping units, in which case a unit
    from one source is matched with a similar (but not identical) unit
    from another source. Records with values obtained from different
    sources can also arise as a consequence of item non-response and
    subsequent imputation, in which case the two sources are the
    directly observed values versus the values generated by the
    imputation method. In all these cases the composition of a record by
    combining information obtained from different sources may lead to
    consistency problems because the information is conflicting, in the
    sense that edit rules that involve variables obtained from the
    different sources are violated. The purpose of editing conflicting
    micro-data is to achieve numerical consistency in the first instance
    and, ultimately, statistical consistency of the resulting
    aggregates.

221. For example, a survey provides an aggregated value A for the total
    income received from social allowances received by person x; this
    value A should be equal to the sum of two types of allowances B
    (health) and C (education) collected through administrative sources.
    If A is not equal to the sum of B and C, this inconsistency should
    be removed by using micro integration methods[^13] like prorating,
    minimum adjustment methods, or generalised Ratio Adjustments. In the
    case of data on refugee and internally displaced persons, such
    aggregation rules when integrating several sources should be rather
    rare, but their existence should be checked on a case by case basis,
    and data compilers should take them into account if necessary. Micro
    integration or editing conflicting micro-data needs to be
    distinguished from variable harmonisation (later on described) which
    applies to situations where there exist similar versions of the same
    target variable, for instance due to different definitions across
    the sources.

### Creation of joint statistical micro data {#d.2.-creation-of-joint-statistical-micro-data .ListParagraph}

222. A full description of a) *data linkage: combining data from several
    sources belonging to the same group, and b) data matching: inference
    of joint distribution from marginal observations, can be found in
    greater detail in Part III of this Manual* *Creation of joint
    statistical micro data. *

223. The integration of data at micro level with the main purpose of
    accurately reflecting the individual's real-world circumstances at
    individual micro level, even when the data are stored in different
    sources of various types, is known as record linkage. Ultimately,
    the record linkage process creates a micro dataset where the
    corresponding separate observations are combined into joint
    statistical data drawn from information which originate in multiple
    sources. Record linkage is also referred to as object
    identification, record matching, entity matching, entity resolution,
    or reference reconciliation. In the case of the National Statistical
    Institutes (NSIs) the joint use of statistical and administrative
    sources is a product of a rationalization of all the available
    sources in order to reduce costs, response burden and, most of all,
    to enrich the information collected in order to produce high quality
    statistics.

224. An important distinction between record linkage and statistical
    matching needs to be made, the former regards the "fusion" of
    sources composed mainly of the same units, partially or completely
    overlapping, e.g., in the case of integration of administrative
    registers and sample surveys, while the latter concerns the
    integration of different units, e.g. derived from different sample
    surveys.

225. The record linkage problem requires statistical estimation methods
    when unique identifiers are not available for all the units in the
    sources, or the unique keys are affected by errors, or a unique
    composite key can be derived from a combination of error-prone
    variables. The presence of errors in the unit identifiers and the
    use of statistical estimation methods for linking data files, may
    introduce linkage errors in the integrated data. This point needs to
    be taken into consideration by data compilers' during the design of
    the data linkage process. Actually, a standard statistical
    estimation approach can produce inaccurate results in case of
    linkage errors, which requires the use of statistical methods in
    order to evaluate and adjust for linkage errors.

226. In **statistical matching**, also referred to as data fusion, the
    ultimate aim is to provide estimates on variables observed in
    distinct data sources by exploiting the available common information
    (variables observed in both data sources). The data to be joined is
    characterized by representing the same population but not
    necessarily having common units. Thus, statistical matching can be
    framed as an imputation problem in which a missing target variable
    for units in a recipient data set is predicted based on information
    on similar units ("statistical twins") observed in a donor data set.

227. A statistical matching problem can be defined according to its
    objective and data availability:

    82. (objective) knowledge on a (possibly conditional) joint
        distribution function of a couple of random variables, or on
        some of the parameters representing the (conditional) joint
        relationship between the two random variables, or on a data set
        representative of the (conditional) joint distribution of the
        two variables, is requested;

    83. (available data) the two random variables of interest are not
        available jointly in any datasets, but it is possible to use two
        random samples, each one observing one of the two random
        variables, both observing all the conditioning variables.
        Furthermore, the two samples should be representative of the
        same population, but the overlap between the two observed sets
        of units is either null or consists of subsets of units that are
        not representative of the population itself.

228. The two most important outputs that statistical matching can
    produce are: either macro (estimation of a joint distribution or of
    a relationship parameter) or micro (a data set with complete
    observations on the variables of interest, i.e. both the couple of
    random variables and the conditioning variables). It is worthwhile
    noting that the macro approach to statistical matching may be also
    be considered as a 'Multisource estimation at aggregated level'. In
    the field of refugee and IDP statistics, the micro-objective (fusion
    of two datasets) is the most frequent possible use of data matching.

229. A full description of deterministic and probabilistic linking, with
    examples, can be found in Part III) Creation of joint statistical
    micro data.

### Alignment of populations and measurements {#d.3.-alignment-of-populations-and-measurements .ListParagraph}

*a. Alignment of populations: Unit harmonisation*

230. When data originating from multiple sources are used, one needs to
    transform objects into statistical units referring to the target
    population. This is a mandatory requirement valid both for usages
    based on a single data source, and for cases based on multisource
    data. After a preliminary analysis aimed at verifying such a
    consistency, it is sometimes necessary to start a process of
    harmonisation or alignment of statistical units. For example, when
    combining survey data with administrative registers, to create a
    living household as the ideal unit for refugee or IDP statistics,
    one needs to make use of units such as person, family, residence
    address, study or workplace address, etc. The different units need
    first to be aligned with each other, in order to improve the
    accuracy of the living household created based on them.

231. Possible estimation methods: No general statistical methods are
    available, while ad-hoc deterministic methods are generally used.
    For instance, statistical units are derived using certain
    deterministic derivation rules based on available information.

*b. Alignment of measurements: Variable harmonisation*

232. When administrative data are used, one needs to transform
    attributes of the objects into measurements referring to the
    concepts to be measured, that is the target variables. After a
    preliminary analysis aimed at verifying such a consistency, it is
    sometimes necessary to start a process of harmonisation or alignment
    of measurements.

233. When data from multiple sources are combined, differences in
    definition can occur between variables in different sources. In
    particular, variables in an administrative data source are defined
    according to the administrative purposes of the register owner.
    These definitions may differ from those of the target variables for
    statistical purposes. For example, when the variable 'age-group' is
    observed in two data sources with different groups. A technique for
    obtaining a unique variable 'age' is needed. This apparently
    deterministic task can involve statistical estimation method (e.g.,
    classification techniques) whenever a well-defined mapping is not
    known.

234. In case differences in variable definitions occur between data
    sources, these variables need to be harmonised during data
    integration. That is to say, for each unit in the integrated data
    set, the values of the target variable according to the desired
    definition need to be estimated from the observed values that are
    available.

### Multisource estimation at aggregated level {#d.4.-multisource-estimation-at-aggregated-level .ListParagraph}

235. This task refers to the phase of production of estimates by using
    integrated multisource administrative data. Estimation methods in
    this case must deal with the problem that data are not obtained
    according to a random sampling design, and that observations may
    refer to specific subsets of units of the population
    (under-coverage), or out-of-scope units (over-coverage). In
    addition, when integrated multisource data are used, specific
    problems may arise. They are concerned with the problem of
    consistency and coherence of estimates.

236. Part III of this Manual (paragraphs 836-869) describes a number of
    estimation and reconciliation techniques in much further detail
    including:

*a. Population size estimation: multiple lists with imperfect coverage
of target population.*

237. When each one of the multiple sources has imperfect coverage of the
    target population, including both under- and over-coverage,
    statistical methods for population size estimation are needed. The
    most common approaches relate to capture-recapture (CRC) methods. In
    estimating a population size based on several sources, the
    misalignment between the scope of the administrative data and that
    of the statistician poses several methodological challenges and sets
    us apart from a classical capture-recapture setting. For instance,
    it is often useful to develop methods taking into account the
    dependence among data sources, the fact that some data sources refer
    to a specific subpopulation, and that data may contain units
    out-of-the target population that are not deterministically
    identifiable.

238. In the case of refugees or IDPs statistics, the first assumption
    can be considered as true if the time between the capture and
    recapture is limited. Otherwise, deaths, births, and moves of the
    population of interest will break the hypothesis of a closed
    population. The validity of the second assumption depends on the
    quality of the available identifier for linking the sources.
    Difficult to reach refugees or IDPs through surveys will most likely
    not be recorded in administrative registers, which can break the
    third assumption and imply a problem of under-coverage. The fourth
    assumption corresponds to the fact that for example children, women
    and men have the same probability of inclusion. In case this is not
    verified, applying the CRC method to each identified specific group
    before proceeding to an aggregation of the results found for each
    group. Lastly, the fifth hypothesis could be assumed to be verified
    in most of the cases.

239. The violation of these assumptions can lead to serious bias in the
    CRC-estimation of the population size. CRC is in particular
    sensitive to violation of the assumption in the case of a low
    implied coverage, i.e. the second register overlaps greatly with the
    first register and adds relatively few new records to it. So,
    several extensions of the CRC method were proposed in order to face
    problems connected to violation of the basic assumptions, we can
    divide them into two group: methods aiming at improving the
    CRC-method; alternatives methods.

*b. Reconciliation*

240. Different estimates for the same phenomenon could lead to confusion
    among users of these figures. Many NSIs have therefore adopted a
    one-figure policy. According to this one-figure policy, estimates
    for the same phenomenon in different tables should be reconciled,
    meaning that they should be equal to each other, even if these
    estimates are based on different underlying data sources.

241. When using a mix of administrative data sources and surveys on
    which to base estimates upon, obtaining one estimate for the same
    phenomenon may become problematic as for different (combinations of)
    variables data on different units, e.g. different persons, may be
    available.

242. This means that different estimates concerning the same variable
    may yield different results, if one does not take special
    precautions. For instance, if one uses a standard weighting approach
    to produce estimates, where one multiplies observed counts or values
    with surveys weights, one may get different estimates based on two
    samples, because different units and hence different survey weights
    are used in the two samples.

243. In principle, these differences are merely caused by "noise" in the
    data, such as sampling errors. So, in a strictly statistical sense,
    different estimates concerning the same variables are to be expected
    and are not a problem. However, different estimates would violate
    the one-figure policy and form a problem for the users.

### Examples of good practices {#d.5.-examples-of-good-practices .ListParagraph}

#### Work Package 1 of the ESS Vision 2020 ADMIN: Access to and development of administrative data sources

244. The European Statistical System [ESS Vision
    2020](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/ess/about-us/ess-vision-2020) highlights
    the importance of cooperation with stakeholders and of developing
    strategic alliances with private and public partners (key area
    \"identifying user needs and cooperation with stakeholders\"). In
    particular, the ESS Vision 2020 ADMIN (Administrative data sources)
    project carried out several tasks related to the access to
    administrative sources. The goal of this project is to help ESS
    Member States to make wider and better use of administrative sources
    in the production of official statistics. This means addressing the
    most typical challenges faced in the use of these sources: limited
    access to the data, the lack of quality of the sources,
    methodological issues related to the processing of the data and the
    integration of several sources. It is also important to ensure that
    the European statistics produced using administrative data are
    comparable across Member States and are of sufficient quality. The
    first work package[^14] of ESS Vision 2020 ADMIN answers this by
    aiming to identify and share best practices on cooperating with the
    owners of administrative sources. (see Phase *1.5. Check Data
    Availability* for reports and more information)[^15].

#### The population register and links to other administrative registers in Norway 

245. The Central Population Register (CPR) of Norway was established in
    1964 based on the 1960 Population Census. A unique 11-digit personal
    identification number (PIN) was introduced at the same time. The CPR
    includes all persons who has ever been a (legal) resident of Norway
    since 1960, regardless of their citizenship. Persons who die or
    emigrate are not deleted from the register, but a code for their
    status is changed.

246. The most important stock (or status) variables in the CPR are:
    11-digit PIN (which includes date of birth and sex), residence
    status (resident, deceased, emigrated, no permanent address,
    disappeared), address, municipality, dwelling number, place of birth
    (municipality or country), name (incl. first and middle names),
    citizenship, country of immigration, country of emigration, marital
    status, PIN of spouse, mother and father.

247. Persons who have come to Norway as refugees or asylum seekers are
    included in the CPR once they are recognized as legal residents.
    Refugees who arrive via UNHCR are given a PIN on arrival. Asylum
    seekers are assigned another ID number, called the D-number, when
    they apply for asylum. The D-number is used for administrative
    purposes for people who are not residents of Norway but who have
    economic or other links to Norway. It is only when a person is
    granted asylum that he or she is assigned a PIN number. Persons with
    D-numbers are not included in the official population statistics for
    Norway

248. All vital events and migrations and address changes are registered
    in the CPR. The most important flow variables are births, deaths,
    marital changes (incl. same-sex marriages, separations, divorces and
    annulments), emigrations and immigrations, internal moves in Norway,
    address changes, name changes, citizenship changes, gender changes
    and PIN changes. When a report of a change is received by the CPR
    the information is checked, for example, that the spouses of a new
    marriage are not already married and that the parents of a new-born
    baby are residents.

249. The inclusion of the PINs of parents and spouses in the CPR makes
    it possible to establish links between siblings, cousins, children,
    grandparents and other relatives. The PIN is used in a large number
    of other administrative registers, which makes it possible to link
    information in different registers for statistics and research. The
    CPR is also used to draw samples for sample surveys. The contents,
    coverage and quality of the administrative registers have become so
    good that it is not any longer necessary to conduct traditional
    population and housing censuses. The last regular census was
    conducted in 2001, whereas the 2011 census was completely based on
    register data.

250. The two figures below show the flows of data on individuals
    (microdata) to and from the CPR. The entity at the middle of both
    figures, "Population register", functions both as the central
    register of civil events in Norway and as the country's population
    register. Thus, civil registration and national identity management
    are fully integrated. Births to residents of Norway and new
    immigrants are assigned personal identification numbers. Residents
    who die or emigrate are not physically removed from the register,
    but their codes are changed from "Resident" to "Dead" or
    "Emigrated".

251. The first figure shows that the population register receives
    microdata *from* many public (and some private) institutions on
    births, deaths, many external migrations, marriages and divorces,
    adoptions, address changes, name changes, and other events. It also
    receives information directly from the individuals themselves on
    internal migration, many external migrations, and name changes.

252. It should be noted that the population register does not receive
    any microdata *from* Statistics Norway, with a few exceptions, in
    keeping with the fundamental principles of statistics, that
    individual data collected by statistical agencies for statistical
    compilation are to be strictly confidential and used exclusively for
    statistical purposes. The second figure shows the public and private
    institutions *to* which the Norwegian Tax Administration distributes
    microdata. Statistics Norway is one of the most important recipients
    and users of these data, together with health and educational
    institutions, the police, the army, the electoral register, banks,
    and other bodies.

253. The task of sharing the microdata is not performed by Statistics
    Norway, but by the owner of the administrative register, the
    Norwegian Tax Administration. Statistics Norway may, however, share
    anonymized data on individuals if this is approved by the data
    inspector.

Figure 2.1: Data flows to the Norway Population Register

generated](media/image24.png){width="6.844444444444444in"
height="4.597222222222222in"}

254. Statistics Norway receives updates on vital events and other
    changes in the register every night, five days a week, following the
    same routine as many other users of the population register that
    need daily updates for administrative purposes. The updates are
    verified every morning. The diagram below shows the relationship
    between the administrative and statistical population registers.
    Statistics Norway maintains two versions of the population register:

-   A true copy of the administrative register;

-   A separate statistical population register, in which internal
    adjustments and amendments are made and saved.

Figure 2.2: Copies of registers in Norway

![A close up of a logo Description automatically
generated](media/image25.png){width="4.50625in"
height="2.1951388888888888in"}

255. The key reason for this approach is that the administrative
    register is incomplete and may include errors and other
    shortcomings, such as missing data. Statistics Norway has access to
    many other administrative and statistical data sources and can link
    them to the copy of the central population register to check for
    possible errors or add information, such as country of birth if not
    registered by the CPR. This information cannot be shared with the
    Tax Administration without permission from the other sources for
    confidentiality reasons, but it still has an impact on the quality
    of the statistics produced. Statistics Norway may, however, report
    faulty microdata (including the PIN) back to the register owner,
    including the Tax Administration, as this may be considered a
    complaint regarding the quality of the data received. These error
    correction procedures must be in line with the principle that data
    relating to individuals should not be returned from a statistical
    agency to a supplier. The quality improvements mean that, in most
    cases, the statistical population register is a better source for
    statistics production than the administrative population register
    (CPR) would have been.

256. It is not possible to identify refugees/(former) asylum seekers
    directly in the CPR as information about reason for
    migration/residence permit is not one of the variables that is
    included in the original transactions from the CPR. However, this
    information is collected on a yearly basis where Statistics Norway
    receives data from the Directorate of Migration (this procedure is
    described more in detail in box 4.6 in the IRRS) and link these data
    using the PIN to match the statistical version with the CPR. Based
    on this information, Statistics Norway produces both flow and stock
    data on persons with a refugee background, see:
    <https://www.ssb.no/en/befolkning/statistikker/flyktninger/aar>[.]{.underline}

#### **Maintenance of a register for statistical purposes -- construction of the variable migration category in Norway:**

257. In Norway, population, migration and refugee statistics -- both on
    stocks and on flows - is primarily based on register data from the
    Central Population Register (CPR), a register situated in the
    Norwegian Tax Administration. Statistics Norway (SSB) maintains a
    copy of the CPR -- kept for statistical purposes - and receives
    electronic transaction data from the CPR every night.

258. The same definitions are used in both the CPR and in the SSB copy
    of the register and routines for updating correspond closely. The
    result is a good correspondence between the two registers, even
    after many years with physically independent updating routines.
    However, in addition to the variables received from the CPR, SSB
    constructs several variables that are needed for statistical
    purposes.

259. One of these is the variable 'migration category' which is used for
    determining the population with immigrant background. See Figure
    2.3.

Figure 2.3: Code combinations Norway

![A close up of text on a white background Description automatically
generated](media/image26.png){width="4.311805555555556in"
height="2.9868055555555557in"}

260. The variable is based on the person's own country of birth,
    parent's country of birth and grandparent's country of birth. All
    these are derived from the CPR. From this variable SSB constructs
    the following categories used for its migration statistics.

-   Immigrants - persons born abroad of two foreign-born parents and
    four foreign-born grandparents.

-   Norwegian-born to Immigrant Parents -- persons born in Norway of two
    parents born abroad and in addition have four grandparents born
    abroad. This category was earlier labelled "Second generation
    migrants".

261. In the statistics on 'persons with a refugee background' (see other
    reference in this document) only those who themselves have
    immigrated are included. However, through using the variable
    'migration category' it is possible to follow the children of
    refugees and study their integration into Norwegian society.

####  Federal Statistical Office of Germany on data integration in the absence of unique identifiers - Using machine learning to impute refugee status in survey data 

262. Following the unprecedented increase in asylum applications in 2015
    and 2016, the integration of refugees in housing markets, labour
    markets and in civic society is still a major priority for policy
    makers in Germany. Accordingly, policy makers demand for data on the
    situation of refugees, in order to monitor the progress of
    integration and to derive implications for integration policies. The
    idea of integrating data sources to satisfy this demand is
    intuitively appealing. Data integration is cost effective and
    imposes no additional response burden since information is produced
    by making better use of already existing data.

263. In general, countries differ with respect to their data environment
    and hence face different possibilities for integrating data sources.
    Differences largely depend on whether or not unique person
    identifiers exist in administrative data bases and whether or not
    the legal framework allows their use in official statistics. While
    matching datasets via unique identifiers represents the gold
    standard, the vast majority of countries will not be able to link
    information on refugees via unique identifiers within the
    foreseeable future. In this data environment statistical matching
    offers an alternative tool for integrating datasets. Statistical
    matching is usually described as the joint analysis of variables
    that are not jointly observed but available in different datasets.
    In contrast to record linkage that links information on identical
    units, statistical matching can hence be framed as an imputation
    problem in which a target variable in a recipient data set is
    predicted based on information on similar units -- "statistical
    twins" -- in a donor data set.

264. The data environment in which statistics on refugees and people in
    refugee-like situations are produced in Germany is typical for many
    countries: Germany uses administrative data on residence permits
    from the Central Register of Foreigners (CRF) to identify refugees
    and foreigners in refugee like situations. While the CRF confidently
    identifies and comprehensively covers refugees, it does not provide
    information on their socioeconomic characteristics or housing and
    living conditions. In addition, German official statistics uses the
    Labour Force Survey (LFS) for shedding light on the socioeconomic
    characteristics and the structural integration of first- and
    second-generation immigrants in Germany. While the LFS provides a
    detailed socioeconomic picture on these immigrants, it does neither
    confidently identify nor comprehensively cover refugees and
    foreigners in refugee-like situations.

265. Considering the production of statistics on refugees and people in
    refugee-like situations, the problem can be formally stated as
    follows: the information from the administrative data set (donor)
    are used in order to impute refugee status in the survey data set
    (recipient). For imputation a set of common variables (C) is used.
    The final aim is analysing the unobserved joint distributions of
    refugee status (R) and socioeconomic characteristics (S).

<!-- -->

(1) Donor with ${C_{i},\ R}_{i}$

(2) Recipient with $C_{i},\ S_{i}$

(3) Prediction $\widehat{R_{i}} = f(C_{i})$

(4) Synthetic data set with $C_{i},S_{i},\ \widehat{R_{i}}$

height="3.1819444444444445in"}

266. This case-study aims at integrating the CRF and LFS via statistical
    matching to combine reliable information on residence status with a
    broad set of socioeconomic characteristics, e.g. educational
    background and labour market participation. The common information
    on citizenship, date of entry, age and gender are used to impute
    refugee status for respondents of the LFS. For this task, a boosted
    and post-pruned Classification and Regression Tree (CART - C5.0) in
    the CRF is developed and used to identify refugees among LFS
    respondents. Statistical inference after statistical matching is
    implicitly based on the restrictive but untestable assumptions of
    conditional independence. Therefore, the case-study emphasizes the
    importance of carefully evaluating model performance and guides the
    reader through a framework of possible evaluation techniques.

267. In summary, this case-study adds to the existing literature in two
    ways: First, statistical matching techniques have not yet been
    applied to the field of refugee statistics -- a field in which they
    might be especially beneficial since they offer a quick and cheap
    alternative compared to traditional forms of data collection for
    refugee hosting countries. Secondly, the field of data science has
    developed rapidly over the last decade. Powerful classification
    algorithms have emerged that have not yet been exhaustively tested
    in the statistical matching environment. As a convenient feature,
    those algorithms are implemented in open source software[^16] making
    this study reproducible for a broad audience.

Design production systems and workflow
-------------------------------------------

"This sub-process determines the workflow from data collection to
dissemination, taking an overview of all the processes required within
the whole statistical production process, and ensuring that they fit
together efficiently with no gaps or redundancies. Various systems and
databases are needed throughout the process. A general principle is to
reuse processes and technology across many statistical business
processes, so existing production solutions (e.g. services, systems and
databases) should be examined first, to determine whether they are fit
for purpose for this specific process, then, if any gaps are identified,
new solutions should be designed. This sub-process also considers how
staff will interact with systems, and who will be responsible for what
and when". (UNECE, 2013)

### Introduction {#introduction .ListParagraph}

268. This section deals with fitting together the various components of
    the design into a coherent whole. It also includes the design of the
    quality assurance processes through which statistics should be
    evaluated for quality.

269. The gathering and harmonisation of data on displaced people are the
    key to international comparative analysis and policy work on forced
    displacement. The timely, accurate statistical information on IDP,
    asylum and refugee statistics enables a wide range of policy answer
    in the rapidly evolving forced displacement caused by humanitarian
    crises.

270. The objectives of this IDP, asylum and refugee-related statistical
    production system is to improve efficiency of data and metadata
    collection, validation, processing, storage and dissemination. It is
    also a target of a well-functioning statistical production system to
    improve quality by eliminating errors and incoherencies, and by
    shortening the statistical publication cycles. The accessibility and
    visibility of the asylum related statistical outputs should also be
    a key objective.

271. In order to achieve these targets a modern statistical production
    system should utilize of advances of modern information technologies
    and standards.

### The statistical production environment {#the-statistical-production-environment .ListParagraph}

272. Before developing a statistical production system, the data sources
    of this system should be determined. Based on their supervising body
    in the national data production system, there are two types of data
    sources which can feed these systems.

273. The first type is part of the national statistical system, this is
    the administrative data source where the data owners are an
    integrated part of the national public administration. In this case
    the country's government with its public administration is present
    and a national legislation is available which regulates the asylum
    procedure or IDP registration. Parallel to the national legislation
    are specialized administrative bodies or custodian agencies
    responsible for the IDP or asylum procedure and for the collection
    of the administrative data related to the procedures.

274. In this case the statistical data are by-products of the
    administrative procedure. In an optimal situation the IDP or asylum
    procedures are supported by IT-systems, and case-management systems
    where the data are stored and can be queried. This case-management
    system is interlinked with a statistical sub-system, it means that
    the case-management system should have an interface where the
    statistical queries can be set. In this production system chain the
    case-management system is the input for the statistical subsystem,
    it is not part of the statistical data production system.

275. The statistical sub-system should ensure the ideal technical
    environment for data production and for the metadata production
    environment as well. The statistical production system should have
    also a link to the data storage warehouse, which is a dedicated part
    of the statistical production system. In the storage system the data
    are stored, if possible, in so called cubes, these cubes should have
    a link to the dissemination system which enables the statistical
    data publication via user interfaces. According to the methodology
    of the data inquiry we can differentiate between static systems
    where the data can be requested via static tables e.g. Excel tables
    or html tables. The other way is to enable the compilation of
    user-friendly, interactive statistical tables.

276. The second type of data source describes an IDP or asylum system
    where the national legislation is not so well developed as in the
    first case, and a dedicated governmental custodian body for the
    asylum procedure is not functional. Refugee status-determinations
    can be undertaken by UNHCR in contrast to status determination
    carried out by a government. In the latter case the responsible
    agency for the asylum procedure is an international UN organisation
    such as UNWRA or UNHCR. The data source is the administrative system
    of this international organization which collects data related to
    the IDP or asylum procedure and also disseminates statistics at the
    international level.

277. If such an asylum related statistical system is available, the
    international organization serves as the producer of the input for
    the national public administration. A memorandum of agreement could
    enhance the cooperation between organizations of public
    administration and the UNHCR which is directly involved in providing
    shelter for asylum seekers and refugees and in data collection (see
    Part 2 *UNHCR Agreements and Memoranda of Understanding* for an
    example of this).

    '*UNHCR collects data on persons in concern i.e. refugees,
    asylum-seekers, internally displaced persons (IDPs), returnees and
    stateless persons. The data collection includes information on
    country of origin and of asylum, sex age and location or settlement
    such as camp or centre. Furthermore, information about protection
    and living conditions is also gathered with variables such as
    education, health, nutrition as well as information regarding sexual
    and gender-based violence.*'[^17]

278. The main obstacle to data collection is the lack of harmonised
    definitions and measurement criteria which can occur in cases when
    the country did not comply with the 1951 Geneva Convention relating
    to the Status of Refugees (See IRRS Chapter 2), or in the case of
    IDPs observe the *Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement*[^18]
    The lack of harmonisation can be especially problematic if the
    translation of definitions of the convention into national law is
    not done in a systematic and harmonised way, and not in observance
    of the Recommendations set out in the IRRS or IRIS. Other factors
    which can make the data collection difficult are differences in
    quality and periodicity.

### The statistical database environment {#the-statistical-database-environment .ListParagraph}

279. When establishing a statistical production system there are also
    some criteria related to the technical details and functionalities
    of the system which should be analysed more detailed. It is
    recommended to develop a common hosting environment for production
    databases, the idea behind the common production system is that it
    strengthens standardisation of the statistical data production and
    it minimises the number of tools used in statistical activities and
    reduces training and support requirements.

280. It is recommended that the statistical data production system
    should include a toolkit which enables the management of statistical
    data, this toolkit should include different facilities, such as:

-   data migration[^19],

-   security management,

-   database administration (management of user access rights)

-   data collection,

-   data validation,

-   data-query toolkit,

-   metadata management system.

281. When planning a statistical data production system, it is essential
    to design a centralized metadata storage system which enhances the
    efficiency of metadata preparation, storage, access, management and
    dissemination. The centralized metadata system addresses the
    problems of fragmented metadata located in numerous databases. The
    metadata sub-system of the statistical production system should meet
    some basic expectations, such as:

-   the metadata system should have a common structure, defining common
    metadata items,

-   all statistical data should have appropriate metadata,

-   it should cover a broad group of user needs,

-   the metadata must be consistent across the different subject matter
    areas.

-   The metadata system should accommodate any kind of metadata related
    to the corresponding statistical data.

Eurostat's Single Integrated Metadata Structure (SIMS)[^20]

The Single Integrated Metadata Structure is the dynamic inventory of
statistical concepts used for quality and metadata reporting in the
European Statistical System.

The Single Integrated Metadata Structure streamlines and harmonises
metadata and quality reporting in the European Statistical System (ESS)
and it decreases the reporting burden on the statistical authorities by
creating the framework for "once for all purposes". It is an integrated
quality and metadata reporting framework, which ensures a flexible and
up to date system where future extensions are possible.

The system enables that the same concept names and the same quality
indicators are used in the different ESS metadata structures, it also
enhances the consistency with the SDMX statistical standards as it
stands in the SDMX Content-oriented Guidelines.

It has to be underlined that data users and data producers have
different needs on statistical information and this has to be reflected
by the quality reports that are addressed to them. The distinction
between the user and producer oriented quality reporting is assured
through the Single Integrated Metadata Structure.

Based on this approach there are two different quality reporting systems
available within the SIMS, the user-(U) and producer (P) --oriented
quality reporting. The short user-oriented quality report is implemented
through the improved visibility and readability of the quality related
concepts and the producer-oriented quality report (P) is implemented via
the ESQRS[^21] report structure.

### Statistical dissemination process {#statistical-dissemination-process .ListParagraph}

282. It is essential that the design of the statistical production
    system (the statistical production database) should interlinked with
    the dissemination system, this system enables the establishment of a
    modernised tool for traditional statistical publications and
    interactive data products.

283. For the dissemination system the data source is the statistical
    production system, the production database, it increases the
    efficiency of statistical dissemination and reduces the risk of
    mistakes, enables more timely publication of statistics.

284. The improved statistical dissemination system ensures a common
    layout and reduces the number of different software applications in
    use. The recommended statistical publication tool should have an
    interface for managing publication contents definition and it is
    also necessary to have an interface for generating XML output file
    in order to combine statistical data and metadata.

285. A workflow model should be developed which monitors the complex
    statistical data production from the production of statistical data
    to the production of metadata, through the storage of the
    statistical data. This complex model also monitors the statistical
    channels used for monitors.

### Indicator system for measuring the design production systems and workflow[^22] {#indicator-system-for-measuring-the-design-production-systems-and-workflow .ListParagraph}

286. In order to measure the effectiveness of the statistical production
    system and workflow an indicator system should be established which
    can measure the effectiveness of the statistical production with
    indicators like, soundness of the implementation, the cost
    effectiveness, accuracy and reliability, timeliness and punctuality
    and last but not least accessibility and clarity.

287. A suitable indicator system can be seen in the table below, in the
    following this indicator system is presented: the indicator
    soundness of implementation measures the quality of the workflow in
    the design and production system phase of the GSBPM structure. It
    identifies the different sub-processes being part of this phase. The
    soundness of implementation should take into consideration the types
    of the data which are processed (admin data or survey type data) in
    this phase, because it affects the specifications of the indicator
    system.

288. It should be also outlined that the cost of designing a statistical
    production system plays an important role, it is necessary to reduce
    the costs of the different software tools. In order to achieve this
    goal, the best solution is the use of common applications. The
    products should be disseminated (see also Phase 7 *Dissemination*)
    on an appropriate platform, e.g. on the home page of the body
    responsible for statistical data production which can also increase
    the costs of the statistical production but using optimal software
    and technical solutions this cost can be reduced.

289. The indicator 'accuracy and reliability' measures the ratio of
    quality indicators used as performance indicators, the source data,
    integrated data, intermediate results and statistical outputs should
    be regularly assessed and validated.

290. The next indicator, 'timeliness and punctuality' defines the time
    frame which is available for the production in the different
    sub-processes.

291. According to the last indicator in the list, 'accessibility and
    clarity', the number of visitors of the home page or other social
    media products of the statistical data producer is calculated.
    During the performance of this statistical data production system a
    quality indicator system can ensure a permanent feedback on the
    production system.

    the IASC Framework. Under the leadership of the Mandate of the UN
    Special Rapporteur on the Human Rights of IDPs, a group of
    development, humanitarian and peacebuilding actors started work on
    developing and testing indicators and guidance for comprehensive
    durable solutions analysis in internal displacement situations and
    to measure progress over time. The work, coordinated by the Joint
    IDP Profiling Service, resulted in a library of standardised
    indicators and guidance for the operationalization of the eight IASC
    criteria and can serve as a unified starting point for statistical
    analysis on various characteristics of displacement related
    vulnerabilities. For more information on this process, please see:
