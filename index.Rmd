Mainstreaming Displacement Statistics
------------------------------------------

### Introduction {#introduction .ListParagraph}

11. The numbers of refugees, asylum seekers and internally displaced
    persons (IDPs) have increased rapidly in recent years. Moreover,
    almost every country in the world is affected by forced displacement
    either as a source, point of transit, or host of refugees, asylum
    seekers or IDPs, making forced displacement a global phenomenon.
    However, developing countries are disproportionately affected by
    forced displacement, and there is a growing consensus that greater
    international cooperation is required to assist host countries and
    affected host communities.

12. This manual is concerned with forced displacement, people who are
    forcibly displaced from their homes either by disaster or by
    conflict. These displaced people include those who cross an
    international border (refugees and related populations covered by
    the IRRS), and those who remain in the country from which they were
    displaced (Internally Displaced Persons covered by IRIS). Recent
    global estimates suggest that the majority of displaced people are
    displaced within the borders of their own countries (IDMC 2019).

13. The scale of the problem is growing, although it is difficult to
    obtain a global estimate for all types of displaced people as the
    mandates of the various international agencies providing estimates
    do not cover the universe of displaced people. The Institute of
    Migration tells us that "*by the end of 2017, 68.5 million
    individuals were forcibly displaced worldwide due to persecution,
    conflict, generalized violence and human rights violations. This is
    almost double the number of forcibly displaced people recorded in
    1997*[^1]*.* The IoM goes on to say that "*By the end of 2017, the
    world was hosting 25.4 million refugees. During 2017 alone, some 2.7
    million people became newly displaced to another country, double the
    amount in 2016".*

14. Using another more recent source for internal displacements, rather
    than for refugees seeking protection in another country, the
    Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre estimated that in 2018
    "*there were 28 million new internal displacements associated with
    conflict and disasters across 148 countries and territories were
    recorded in 2018, with nine countries each accounting for more than
    a million".* It should be noted that there were more displacements
    associated with natural disasters (17.2 million), than with conflict
    (10.8 million).

15. Forced displacement has gained prominence on the international
    agenda. The New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants, adopted
    by the United Nations General Assembly on 19 September 2016,
    recognizes the unprecedented level of human mobility and
    acknowledges the shared responsibility to manage large movements of
    refugees and migrants through international cooperation (United
    Nations, 2016). It also reaffirms the intention of Member States to
    realize the full potential of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
    Development for refugees and migrants. Specifically, under the
    Sustainable Development Goal 10 to reduce inequality within and
    between countries, a key target is "to facilitate the orderly, safe,
    regular and responsible migration and mobility of people, including
    through the implementation of planned and well-managed migration
    policies." The New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants
    explicitly recognizes the needs of refugees, IDPs and migrants in
    the pursuit of this target.

16. With the growing prominence of forced displacement internationally,
    there is increasing interest at national and international levels in
    statistics on refugees, asylum seekers, IDPs and refugee related
    populations, including complete, accurate, timely and
    internationally comparable estimates of the numbers of people
    displaced. Estimates of these populations are increasingly relevant
    for official statistics, which need to take account of forcibly
    displaced populations in a consistent manner. Incomplete or
    inadequate statistics on displaced populations undermine the
    estimation of population stocks, which in turn affects other
    statistics, particularly those measured in per capita terms.

17. Much of the available data on refugees and IDPs is not generated as
    official statistics produced by the statistical systems of national
    governments but arise from operational data that is collected by a
    variety of actors in response to a national emergency. This is data
    collected for the purpose of supporting displaced people, rather
    than for statistical purposes. Displacement contexts can pose
    specific challenges to NSOs, as collecting data during conflict or
    disaster can be challenging and impose obstacles which go beyond the
    usual planning for a new statistical series.

18. Given this, particular attention should be paid to coordination
    between the various partners operating in a country and national
    authorities. In emergency situations some humanitarian data is
    processed by international partners to become international
    estimates and, these estimates need to conform with the standards
    set for official statistics in order to be recognised as
    international statistics. Therefore, at the international level, a
    distinction should also be made between global estimates such as
    those published by the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre,
    which draw on various statistics and data sources, and any
    international statistics which are produced in line with
    recommendations in the IRRS/IRIS, in accordance the quality
    standards set for UN and other international agencies , or published
    by any future custodian of IDP and refugee statistics.

19. The Inter-Agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators accepted the
    proposal of EGRIS members to recommend disaggregation by forced
    displacement categories for 12 priority SDG indicators, as well as
    further broken down by age and sex whenever possible.[^2] In order
    to ensure availability of minimum quality statistics on refugees and
    IDPs, it is recommended that national statistics providers include
    statistics on these priority indicators in the reporting plans for
    the 2030 Agenda.

Coordination of International Partners
-------------------------------------------

20. Some statistical series, particularly those used for monitoring the
    achievement of the SDGs, have been allocated an international
    custodian agency[^3], usually a UN agency. This custodian agency,
    promotes adherence to international statistical principles for the
    thematic area under its control; it collects and publishes national
    official statistics and potentially anonymised micro-data; and
    provides technical support and capacity-building to NSOs and/or
    other national bodies responsible for the production of official
    statistics as part of the NSS.

21. While UNHCR is generally accepted as the custodian agency for
    refugee statistics, the IRIS does not make recommendations on a
    specific custodian, although it outlines the role and
    responsibilities of any future custodian. It envisages that a
    custodian for IDP statistics could be appointed in the future to
    compiling international IDP statistics through a questionnaire,
    follow-up, validation, global publication and re-assessment of data
    collection processes.

22. International coordination is important to prevent duplication, fill
    existing gaps, and to develop national capacity.
