22. A comprehensive approach to understanding and specifying statistical
    needs will help to make national statistical systems meet users'
    needs, or in the case of a new statistical series potential users'
    needs. The development of a roadmap for statistical development can
    be guided by several tools and guidelines developed by PARIS21 based
    at OECD. *Figure 1.1: Tools available to support establishing a
    business case* shows the sub-processes set out the GSBPM and
    indicates where tools are available for establishing a business
    case. These are discussed below.

23. Advocacy from regional and international authorities can play a
    crucial part in raising the priority given to refugee and IDP
    statistics by governments, planning authorities and chief
    statisticians. Effective advocacy includes explicitly documenting
    and specifying the unaddressed needs, targeting a group within the
    national statistical system that can effect change, proposing a
    detailed business case for closing the data gap, and using hard
    evidence as a basis for the business case. Joint approaches in
    strengthening national statistical systems, whether regional or
    international, have often been more effective than individual
    national efforts in capacity building and fundraising for emerging
    areas of official statistics, such as refugee and IDP statistics.

24. As the international statistical system derives its input from
    national statistical systems, establishing a business case for a new
    statistical series requires substantial planning and co-ordination
    at national and international levels alike. Nationally, the
    production of refugee and IDP statistics can require several
    ministries, departments or agencies to cooperate with the national
    statistics office (NSO) to make the resulting statistics fit for
    purpose and relevant to users (Eurostat, 2018).

Identify the Needs of Users and Potential Users
----------------------------------------------------

> "1.1 - This sub-process includes the initial investigation and
> identification of what statistics are needed and what is needed of the
> statistics." (UNECE, 2013)

25. The IRRS and IRIS recommendations propose a list of basic data
    tabulations (IRRS Chapter 3 and IRIS Chapter 5) and indicators (IRRS
    Chapter 5 and IRIS Chapter 4) to be produced at the national level.
    These recommendations serve as the core set of official statistics
    in the displacement domain which includes refugee and related
    persons; and internally displaced persons. However, a country's
    range of statistics will vary, depending on the national policy
    priorities and the reporting requirements of regional international
    users, and the capacity of the National Statistical System and what
    statistics are possible to produce with a reasonable effort

26. In respect of international reporting obligations, it should be
    noted that the Inter-Agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators
    accepted the proposal of EGRIS members to recommend disaggregation
    by forced displacement categories for 12 priority SDG indicators, as
    well by age and sex whenever possible.[^1] In order to ensure
    availability of minimum quality statistics on refugees and IDPs, it
    is recommended that national statistics providers include statistics
    on these priority indicators in the reporting plans for the 2030
    Agenda. However, governments should not feel limited to this
    priority list, and data collection on additional indicators is
    encouraged (IRIS, paragraph 130).

27. There are several potential users of statistics on displaced
    persons, including governments and national authorities, local
    authorities, international organisations, civil society, NGOs,
    researchers/academia, the media and the general public. They have
    different needs and priorities, requiring statistics for different
    purposes:

-   for administrative purposes,

-   for policymaking,

-   for monitoring the implementation of policies,

-   for evaluating policies,

-   to facilitate the allocation of resources,

-   to enable regional/international comparison,

-   to enable comparisons with the wider population,

-   to assess progress towards durable solutions or integration with
    host communities,

-   to inform the general public and enhance public debate.

28. Identifying important "needs gaps" and users' priorities requires
    research. Which can involve a mixed-methods approach, using a
    combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods. A
    useful source of information on the needs of both displaced people
    and the agencies supporting them may be provided by needs
    assessments undertaken by or on behalf on operational agencies
    supporting refugees and IDPs. Needs assessments not only inform
    humanitarian partners but can inform those considering the data
    needs of those supporting the displaced. The UNHCR Needs Assessment
    Handbook provides guidance on their conduct (see also Phase 4
    references *Phase Links and Examples of Training Manuals and Data
    Collection Advice)*. These needs assessments were promoted by the
    World Humanitarian Summit in 2016 and established "commitments for
    aid organizations and donors to work together efficiently,
    transparently, and harmoniously in order to better deliver
    protection and assistance to the millions of people facing emergency
    needs. One of these commitments calls for the improvement of needs
    assessments, notably by:

    1.  Providing a single, comprehensive, cross-sectoral,
        methodologically sound, and impartial overall assessment of
        needs for each crisis to inform strategic decisions;

    2.  Coordinating and streamlining data collection to ensure
        compatibility, quality and comparability, and avoid
        over-assessment and duplication;

    3.  sharing needs assessment data in a timely manner, with the
        appropriate mitigation of protection and privacy risks; and

    4.  Prioritizing humanitarian response across sectors based on
        evidence established by the analysis.[^2]"

29. PARIS21 has developed the [Advanced Data Planning Tool
    (ADAPT)](https://adapt.paris21.org/auth/login)[^3] for NSOs to adapt
    their data production processes to meet the data needs of users. It
    is a consultative tool, which brings data stakeholders together to
    identify data gaps, and define requirements within an established
    monitoring indicator framework such as the UN Sustainable
    Development Goals (SDGs) indicator framework or the basic statistics
    proposed by the IRIS and IRRS (see also the Sustainable Development
    Goal indicators website[^4].)

30. The results of ADAPT can contribute to the development of
    statistical plans, such as National Strategies for the Development
    of Statistics (NSDSs), and processes to strengthen the coordination
    of statistical planning at the national level. ADAPT offers three
    different options to identify indicators affiliated to a given
    statistical framework or specified topic, applicable to refugee and
    IDP statistics. Further details and an explanation of this tool can
    be found in PART III of the document (paragraph 739). Based on the
    information provided, the ADAPT tool can produce two main reports on
    the status of refugee and IDP statistics and identifies any data
    gaps at national level. The first report is able to summarise the
    status of refugee and IDP statistics in respect of the relevant
    national requirements, which could be based on the IRRS or IRIS
    tabulation indicator frameworks, or a national defined requirement.
    The second report presents the status of refugee and IDP statistics
    as a general domain of statistical production, considering all
    indicators that require a relevant disaggregation variable.

Consult and Confirm Needs
------------------------------

> "1.2 - This sub-process focuses on consulting with the stakeholders
> and confirming in detail the needs for the statistics." (UNECE, 2013)

31. National collaboration platforms, for example targeted workshops or
    thematic conferences, and regional fora can be an opportunity to
    engage with the identified strategic stakeholders and promote the
    need for refugee and IDP statistics. Connecting the topics with
    policy priorities at international and national levels can attract
    the attendance of high-level political representatives and help to
    gain government support.

32. Many countries are mandated by their statistics law to set out a
    statistical work programme, an example of this is Turkstat whose
    Official Statistics Programme is based on the Statistics Law of
    Turkey No 5429. Many other countries have statistical development
    plans such as the NSDS described below.

33. [National Strategies for the Development of Statistics
    (NSDSs)](https://nsdsguidelines.paris21.org/node/717) provide a
    framework for structuring support and developing statistical
    capacity in the national statistical system. These multi-annual
    strategies aim at mainstreaming sectors into the national
    statistical system (NSS), engaging with other data producers and
    coordinating the entire NSS, responding to data challenges, and
    building statistical capacity across the "the statistical value
    chain" (PARIS21, 2018). An NSDS can be an integral part of national
    ownership over statistical development, and secure funding at
    national and international level.

34. The implementation of refugee and IDP statistics in these
    statistical development plans, which cover all parts of official
    statistics, can be useful for mainstreaming these statistics into a
    wider national planning process and improving cooperation with the
    data producers involved. This is particularly important with
    displacement statistics as data is likely to be held by many
    agencies including non-traditional sources and the humanitarian
    sector.

35. The NSDS should be firmly linked to national development plans and
    involve several different sectors. Refugee and IDP statistics could
    be considered a sector. The identification of targeted sectors
    varies from country to country depending on national priorities and
    administrative structures. Usually, sectoral strategies correspond
    to line ministries, government departments or agencies with separate
    and well-defined areas of concern, mandate and budget. However, most
    countries do not have a corresponding government ministry or agency
    responsible for monitoring forced migration or displacement, and the
    level political sensitivity within these domains remains at a high
    level.

36. As part of the NSDS process, making the case for developing a
    sectoral strategy for refugee and IDP statistics is important.
    Traditionally in the NSDS process, technical committees are in
    charge of defining sectoral statistical needs, and the number of
    sectors involved is often constrained. Depending on its strategic
    importance to government, refugee and IDP statistics could face
    challenges in being "recognised" as a sectoral statistical area
    within the NSDS process and may require specific advocacy and the
    allocation of a lead government Ministry, Department or Agency.

37. Depending on whether the country has developed a NSDS or not, the
    mid-term evaluation or a new phase of the NSDS can be the right
    moment for integrating a new sectoral strategy related to refugee
    and IDP statistics. Integration of refugee and IDP statistics into
    the NSDS should occur at all stages of the design and implementation
    phases. The process of developing a sectoral strategy for refugee
    and IDP statistics involves the following steps:

### Establishing a Sector Statistics Committee for Displacement Statistics {#establishing-a-sector-statistics-committee-for-displacement-statistics .ListParagraph}

38. Sector Statistics Committees (SSC) are responsible for defining and
    confirming the statistical needs for sectors. The Refugee and IDP
    Statistics Committee should be constituted by those leading of the
    sector at the request of the NSO, and a sector Coordinator should be
    designated. A large number of departments, ministries and agencies
    could be involved, including migration authorities, social
    development ministries, urban planning authorities, rural
    development authorities, and the humanitarian sector. Experience
    shows that five active members are the ideal number for the
    committee, but the Sector Statistics Committee should involve actors
    from the wider data ecosystem and goes beyond the traditional
    boundaries of the NSS, to humanitarian agencies including UNHCR and
    OCHA.

39. The responsibilities of a potential Refugee and IDP Statistics
    Committee would be similar to those of other sectors, including: a)
    proposing a vision for refugee and IDP statistics for approval, b)
    prioritising statistical activities over the lifespan of the
    Sectoral Strategy for the Development of Statistics, c) identifying
    major agencies currently collecting relevant statistics for refugees
    and IDPs, d) preparing an inventory of existent current data systems
    in existence operated by stakeholders, e) identifying major data
    needs related to the sector, f) developing strategic actions,
    including organisational and HR development, IT strategy,
    dissemination policy and other areas.

40. The role of the NSO is important for statistics coordination and to
    ensure that the potential data sources relevant for refugee and
    displacement statistics are able to be used, and that data
    confidentiality is adequately protected under the relevant
    statistics law.

41. The sector statistics design team should consist of staff from
    several ministries (e.g. Interior and External Relations Ministries,
    Migration agency) to ensure commitment and assurance of staff time
    through a more formal process, including memoranda of understanding
    between the agencies and participating ministries. As NSSs are not
    always able to capture forced migration and displacement within
    officially produced data sources, data may be needed from
    non-traditional data producing institutions, such as civil society
    and humanitarian agencies.

### Using operational data from humanitarian agencies for official statistics {#using-operational-data-from-humanitarian-agencies-for-official-statistics .ListParagraph}

42. Where there is insufficient data from government sources for
    statistical purposes, operational data from humanitarian agencies
    present a possible resource for establishing or augmenting a new
    statistical series for refugee and IDP statistics. Operational data
    are produced during regular activities of humanitarian agencies are
    intended for internal use in planning operations only and do not
    usually meet the standards set for official statistics, before use
    they should be carefully assessed using a national or international
    statistical data (e.g. UN Statistics *Quality Assurance Framework
    quality assessment tool).*

43. The quality of any operational data identified for use in a new
    statistical series should be assessed focusing on standardisation,
    coverage, accuracy and confidentiality. Ultimately, the statistical
    authority (e.g. NSO, line ministry, specialised statistical unit
    within NSS) in charge will determine the usefulness of operational
    data as input for the new statistical series after assessing crucial
    quality issues and negotiating data sharing agreements (see IRRS,
    Chapter 6 pp 136-140).

44. One source of operational data is the IASC Common Operational
    Datasets, are developed and endorsed by the Inter-agency Standing
    Committee (IASC) and disseminated by OCHA. These are Common
    Operational Data sets (CODs) and fundamental operational datasets
    (FODs) used in humanitarian emergencies to support technical
    standards, improve the quality of data, and strengthen
    interoperability. In the IASC Common Operational Datasets there are
    three levels of accountability: Guardian, Sponsor and Source. For
    more information see the [IASC Guidelines on Common Operational
    Datasets in Disaster Preparedness and
    Response](https://fscluster.org/sites/default/files/documents/IASC_Guidelines_on_Common_Operational_Datasets_in_Disaster_Preparedness_and_Response_1_Nov._2010%5B1%5D.pdf).

45. The Protection Information Management for Quality Protection
    Outcomes (PIM) Initiative[^5] is a collaborative project, bringing
    together UN, NGO, and other protection and IM partners working to
    respond to protection needs in situations of displacement. The
    objective of PIM is to provide quality data and information on
    people in displacement situations in a safe, reliable, and
    meaningful way. Data on refugees and IDPs can be extremely sensitive
    and confidentiality and data protection are of paramount importance.
    Data collection should be consistent with national legislation on
    data protection and international obligations related to privacy.
    Data protection considerations may limit the access of statisticians
    to information in administrative systems, unless national laws
    establish the right of access to administrative data for statistical
    purposes. This project identifies three different roles for the use
    of PIM data;

    1.  **Guardian:** OCHA is the "Guardian" of the agreed upon datasets
        and will facilitate the distribution of the "best" available
        common operational and fundamental datasets in emergencies while
        managing forums for updates and distribution communication. If
        OCHA is unable to provide this service in a specific country, a
        suitable substitute Guardian should be identified by
        Humanitarian Country Teams or equivalent decision-making body
        during contingency planning. Quality assurance for compliance
        with minimum format and data characteristics in datasets will be
        conducted by OCHA, or the substitute Guardian, prior to
        distribution. This will include assigning a common GLIDE number
        to be associated with the dataset after the onset of a natural
        disaster[^6].

    2.  **Sponsor:** Each dataset has a designated "Sponsor" who is
        responsible for identifying and liaising with relevant "Sources"
        to analyse, collate, clean and achieve consensus around a
        specific operational dataset If possible dataset Sponsors will
        proactively identify and collate information prior to
        emergencies in the data preparedness phase in support of the
        contingency planning process. If this is not possible, Sponsors
        will be identified in relation to their specific dataset early
        in the emergency and will assume responsibilities related to
        their thematic dataset. OCHA will maintain lists of dataset
        Sponsors at the country and global levels and coordinate between
        data Sponsors.

    3.  **Source:** Each dataset will have designated source(s) or
        owner(s), such as: national authority/agency, Cluster, NGO, UN
        agency, International Organization, International Red Cross/Red
        Crescent that agrees to be fully responsible for the
        development, maintenance and metadata associated with a dataset
        and control distribution restrictions.

46. In many countries where governments have limited capacity to
    register refugees, the UNHCR collects administrative data on asylum
    seekers and refugees on behalf of governments. Part III of this
    manual includes an example of the data sharing Agreement on the
    Transfer of Personal Data of Refugees and Asylum-seekers to
    governments under certain conditions (see Part III *UNHCR Agreements
    and Memoranda of* *Understand*ing). They acknowledge the importance
    of registration as a protection tool and expect States to take
    responsibility for registration as quickly as possible. The sharing
    of data needs to be "*subject to the data protection safeguards as
    contained in UNHCR's Policy on the Protection of Persons of
    Concern*[^7]*".* The agreement allows for the *'*compiling
    statistical data' among the allowable purposes for personal data
    transfer. Data may not be transferred to a third party except with
    the prior written authorisation of UNHCR and/or the consent of the
    data subject (the refugee or displaced person). Any third party must
    conform with the conditions set out in the UNHCR data sharing
    agreement. In the case of refugees, the data may not be shared with
    the refugee's country of origin, except under the circumstances of
    voluntary repatriation under the auspices of UNHCR with the consent
    of the individual refugee.

47. The minimum set of indicators identified in the IRRS and IRIS
    recommendations should be considered as the core statistics to
    monitor internal and international displacement and for reporting to
    the global statistical system. However, it is recognised that most
    countries will not reach this minimum initially, and that time will
    be needed to build the capacity to produce these.

Establish Output Objectives
--------------------------------

> "This sub-process identifies the statistical outputs that are required
> to meet the user needs identified in the previous sub-processes."
> (UNECE, 2013)

48. Once a need has been established, the practicalities of developing
    the statistical series will have to be defined. Establishing the
    practicalities include the agreement of users on the suitability of
    and quality measures for the proposed statistical outputs, and the
    recommendation of indicators and levels of disaggregation.
    Furthermore, this sub-process can be used to address any special
    concerns of refugees and IDP through the statistical series that
    could be relevant in the national context (trauma, sensitivity,
    confidentiality, migrating children etc.).

49. There are inherent potential risks of producing displacement
    statistics, as data use would include politically sensitive issues
    such as refugee support, population displacement, integration,
    disaster response and crossing borders. Any data collection effort
    in these domains needs to observe people\`s rights to consent,
    privacy, security and ownership, and consider legal frameworks
    relating to confidentiality, which are both likely to be constraints
    when defining the output objectives.

Identify Concepts
----------------------

> "This sub-process clarifies the required concepts to be measured by
> the business process from the point of view of the user
>
> ." (UNECE, 2013)

50. An internationally agreed refugee and related persons classification
    was agreed in the IRRS 2018 (see Chapter 3) and a similar
    classification for IDPs is set out in IRIS 2020 (see Chapter 3).
    When referring to the refugee population within a given country, the
    IRRS include persons who are "primarily classified in legal terms by
    their claim to refugee status, or their descent from those with or
    seeking international protection" (IRRS, 2018). There are three
    major categories; a) Persons in need of international protection
    which includes refugees, asylum seekers and others granted temporary
    or subsidiary forms of protection; b) Persons with a refugee
    background which includes naturalized former refugees, the children
    and other family members of refugees, and c) Persons returned from
    abroad after seeking international protection. (see IRRS Figure 3.1
    page 30).

51. For IDPs and related populations there are four major categories; a)
    Persons who have displacement-related protection needs (subdivided
    into IDPs in locations of displacement, IDPs in location of return,
    and IDPs in other settlement locations); b) IDP-related populations
    who are the children born after displacement to at least one IDP
    parent; c) Other non-displaced family members of IDPs; and d) Those
    who have overcome key displacement-related vulnerabilities. (See
    IRIS Figure 3.1 page 26).

52. From the point of view of the statistics users, nationally and
    internationally, classificatory differences between national laws
    and international recommendations may be identified. These
    differences may reflect the specific needs of data users. If the
    concepts do not align, the stakeholder should agree on a process to
    approach conformity, and any remaining differences need to clearly
    be identified in the accompanying metadata.

    Classificatory differences mainly may arise due to differences in
    national legislation and it may be required to add the reasons for
    granting asylum. The reference metadata for a new statistical series
    on refugee statistics should pay special attention to describing and
    defining these differences to achieve international comparability of
    refugee statistics. The structure of the reference metadata should
    follow established statistical standards, such as Statistical Data
    and Metadata eXchange (SDMX)[^8].

Check Data Availability
----------------------------

> "This sub-process checks whether current data sources could meet user
> requirements, and the conditions under which they would be available,
> including any restrictions on their use." (UNECE, 2013)

53. The production of refugee and IDP statistics often requires the
    combination of data from several data producers within the national
    statistical system, including line ministries, government
    departments and agencies, and civil society. As national statistical
    systems differ in their level of centralization, the effort needed
    to foster consultation and collaboration between statistical
    producers varies accordingly. Therefore, establishing a statistical
    programme of work, developed jointly by the statistical producers,
    requires an initial mapping of strategic stakeholders to be
    consulted in the consultation for and the confirmation of the
    business case.

54. Accessing data produced by the agencies responsible for displaced
    people for statistical use can be problematic. There are a number of
    reasons why data sharing between agencies for statistical purposes
    can be difficult. These involve legal restrictions and issues of
    trust between officials. While the statistics law is usually clear
    about data confidentiality and the uses to which data can be put,
    the agency collecting the data will also have its own laws and
    regulations which may prohibit data sharing, and the issue becomes
    one of legal precedence. The situation in the European Statistical
    System as at 2015-2017 is set out below in *Table 1.2: National
    Legal Framework - Clarity and coverage of legislation; restrictions
    and limitations. (European Statistical System).*

55. Member States of the European Union and EFTA have statistics laws
    which enables data sharing among government stakeholders. This legal
    framework authorises the NSOs to access administrative sources
    without imposing any restrictions with reference to the provisions
    laid down in the [Regulation (EC)
    223/2009](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:087:0164:0173:En:PDF).
    In this regulation *Article 24, Access to administrative records*
    states;

    *"In order to reduce the burden on respondents, the NSIs and other
    national authorities and the Commission (Eurostat) shall have access
    to administrative data sources, from within their respective public
    administrative system, to the extent that these data are necessary
    for the development, production and dissemination of European
    statistics." *

56. The [ESS Vision
    2020](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/ess/about-us/ess-vision-2020) highlights
    the importance of cooperation with stakeholders and of developing
    strategic alliances with private and public partners (key area
    \"identifying user needs and cooperation with stakeholders\"). A
    workshop was organised in 2016 in order to allow the National
    Statistical Institutes to identify and share best practices on
    cooperating with the owners of administrative sources in order to
    access to administrative data sources ([Workshop on Access to
    Administrative Data
    Sources](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cros/content/2016-workshop-access-administrative-sources_en),
    Brussels, 13-14 September 2016). Between 2015 and 2017, information
    was collected on the obstacles that the NSOs still face in accessing
    administrative data and how they have managed to overcome some of
    the difficulties. On this basis, two reports were finalised in 2018:

    4.  **Report on the legal and institutional environment in Member
        States**: [Final
        report](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cros/system/files/admin-wp1.1_analysis_legal_institutional_environment_final.pdf)

    5.  **Good practices regarding the relation with data
        providers**: [Final
        report](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cros/system/files/admin-wp1.2_good_practices_final.pdf)

57. The above reports set out the situation in European countries which
    illustrate the differences which exist between member states.

58. Examples of other legal provisions for the production of statistics
    about displaced people can be found in Part II Examples and Cases
    studies.

    6.  *The Bosnia and Herzegovina Case Study* cites several examples
        of enabling legal and policy frameworks for the production of
        displacement statistics (see paragraph 542).

    7.  *The Turkey Case Study* cites the ability of Turkstat to access
        administrative data collected under the *Foreigners and
        International Protection law* by the Ministry of the Interior,
        Director General of Migration Management (see Part II Case
        Studies Turkey) under its legally mandated 5-year statistical
        planning cycle (see paragraph 637 for reference to Law mandating
        statistical planning). The Statistics Law of Turkey No 5429 also
        mandates Turkstat for determining the basic principles and
        standards for national registration systems, and for supporting
        and monitoring the organisations involved in the statistical
        production process.

59. Where data is being integrated to combine various sources in order
    to increase the scope and coverage of a statistical series, the
    legal constrains are particularly important. Readers should see also
    *Phase 2D* *a. Legal environment and data protection legislation*
    which discusses data availability at length in respect of data
    integration.

[^6]: Accessing disaster information can be a time consuming and
    laborious task. Not only is data scattered but frequently
    identification of the disaster can be confusing in countries with
    many disaster events. To address both of these issues, **Asian
    Disaster Reduction Center (ADRC)** proposed a globally common Unique
    ID code for disasters. This idea was shared and promoted by the
    Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED) of the
    University of Louvain in Brussels (Belgium), OCHA/ReliefWeb,
    OCHA/FSCC, ISDR, UNDP, WMO, IFRC, OFDA-USAID, FAO, La Red and the
    World Bank and was jointly launched as a new initiative
    \"GLIDE\". <http://glidenumber.net/glide/public/about.jsp>
