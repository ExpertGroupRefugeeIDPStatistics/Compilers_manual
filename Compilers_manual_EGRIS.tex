\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{10}
\item
  The numbers of refugees, asylum seekers and internally displaced
  persons (IDPs) have increased rapidly in recent years. Moreover,
  almost every country in the world is affected by forced displacement
  either as a source, point of transit, or host of refugees, asylum
  seekers or IDPs, making forced displacement a global phenomenon.
  However, developing countries are disproportionately affected by
  forced displacement, and there is a growing consensus that greater
  international cooperation is required to assist host countries and
  affected host communities.
\item
  This manual is concerned with forced displacement, people who are
  forcibly displaced from their homes either by disaster or by
  conflict. These displaced people include those who cross an
  international border (refugees and related populations covered by
  the IRRS), and those who remain in the country from which they were
  displaced (Internally Displaced Persons covered by IRIS). Recent
  global estimates suggest that the majority of displaced people are
  displaced within the borders of their own countries (IDMC 2019).
\item
  The scale of the problem is growing, although it is difficult to
  obtain a global estimate for all types of displaced people as the
  mandates of the various international agencies providing estimates
  do not cover the universe of displaced people. The Institute of
  Migration tells us that ``\emph{by the end of 2017, 68.5 million
  individuals were forcibly displaced worldwide due to persecution,
  conflict, generalized violence and human rights violations. This is
  almost double the number of forcibly displaced people recorded in
  1997}\footnote{\textsuperscript{Ibid~para~94}}\emph{.} The IoM goes on to say that''\emph{By the end of 2017, the
  world was hosting 25.4 million refugees. During 2017 alone, some 2.7
  million people became newly displaced to another country, double the
  amount in 2016".}
\item
  Using another more recent source for internal displacements, rather
  than for refugees seeking protection in another country, the
  Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre estimated that in 2018
  "\emph{there were 28 million new internal displacements associated with
  conflict and disasters across 148 countries and territories were
  recorded in 2018, with nine countries each accounting for more than
  a million".} It should be noted that there were more displacements
  associated with natural disasters (17.2 million), than with conflict
  (10.8 million).
\item
  Forced displacement has gained prominence on the international
  agenda. The New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants, adopted
  by the United Nations General Assembly on 19 September 2016,
  recognizes the unprecedented level of human mobility and
  acknowledges the shared responsibility to manage large movements of
  refugees and migrants through international cooperation (United
  Nations, 2016). It also reaffirms the intention of Member States to
  realize the full potential of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
  Development for refugees and migrants. Specifically, under the
  Sustainable Development Goal 10 to reduce inequality within and
  between countries, a key target is ``to facilitate the orderly, safe,
  regular and responsible migration and mobility of people, including
  through the implementation of planned and well-managed migration
  policies.'' The New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants
  explicitly recognizes the needs of refugees, IDPs and migrants in
  the pursuit of this target.
\item
  With the growing prominence of forced displacement internationally,
  there is increasing interest at national and international levels in
  statistics on refugees, asylum seekers, IDPs and refugee related
  populations, including complete, accurate, timely and
  internationally comparable estimates of the numbers of people
  displaced. Estimates of these populations are increasingly relevant
  for official statistics, which need to take account of forcibly
  displaced populations in a consistent manner. Incomplete or
  inadequate statistics on displaced populations undermine the
  estimation of population stocks, which in turn affects other
  statistics, particularly those measured in per capita terms.
\item
  Much of the available data on refugees and IDPs is not generated as
  official statistics produced by the statistical systems of national
  governments but arise from operational data that is collected by a
  variety of actors in response to a national emergency. This is data
  collected for the purpose of supporting displaced people, rather
  than for statistical purposes. Displacement contexts can pose
  specific challenges to NSOs, as collecting data during conflict or
  disaster can be challenging and impose obstacles which go beyond the
  usual planning for a new statistical series.
\item
  Given this, particular attention should be paid to coordination
  between the various partners operating in a country and national
  authorities. In emergency situations some humanitarian data is
  processed by international partners to become international
  estimates and, these estimates need to conform with the standards
  set for official statistics in order to be recognised as
  international statistics. Therefore, at the international level, a
  distinction should also be made between global estimates such as
  those published by the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre,
  which draw on various statistics and data sources, and any
  international statistics which are produced in line with
  recommendations in the IRRS/IRIS, in accordance the quality
  standards set for UN and other international agencies , or published
  by any future custodian of IDP and refugee statistics.
\item
  The Inter-Agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators accepted the
  proposal of EGRIS members to recommend disaggregation by forced
  displacement categories for 12 priority SDG indicators, as well as
  further broken down by age and sex whenever possible.\footnote{Source IRRS:
    \url{https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/3859598/9315869/KS-GQ-18-004-EN-N.pdf/d331c9cc-1091-43c2-b589-2c250bccc281}
    - page 125.} In order
  to ensure availability of minimum quality statistics on refugees and
  IDPs, it is recommended that national statistics providers include
  statistics on these priority indicators in the reporting plans for
  the 2030 Agenda.

\item
  Some statistical series, particularly those used for monitoring the
  achievement of the SDGs, have been allocated an international
  custodian agency\footnote{Output system is considered as a dissemination system (data
    portal, platform, database etc.) which is offered to external/end
    users of the statistical information/products.}, usually a UN agency. This custodian agency,
  promotes adherence to international statistical principles for the
  thematic area under its control; it collects and publishes national
  official statistics and potentially anonymised micro-data; and
  provides technical support and capacity-building to NSOs and/or
  other national bodies responsible for the production of official
  statistics as part of the NSS.
\item
  While UNHCR is generally accepted as the custodian agency for
  refugee statistics, the IRIS does not make recommendations on a
  specific custodian, although it outlines the role and
  responsibilities of any future custodian. It envisages that a
  custodian for IDP statistics could be appointed in the future to
  compiling international IDP statistics through a questionnaire,
  follow-up, validation, global publication and re-assessment of data
  collection processes.
\item
  International coordination is important to prevent duplication, fill
  existing gaps, and to develop national capacity.

`This phase is triggered when a need for new statistics is identified,
or feedback about current statistics initiates a review. It includes
all activities associated with engaging customers to identify their
detailed statistical needs, proposing high level solution options and
preparing business cases to meet these needs. In this phase the
organisation: identifies the need for the statistics; confirms, in
more detail, the statistical needs of the stakeholders; establishes
the high level objectives of the statistical outputs; identifies the
relevant concepts and variables for which data are required; checks
the extent to which current data sources can meet these needs;
prepares the business case to get approval to produce the statistics'

\item
  A comprehensive approach to understanding and specifying statistical
  needs will help to make national statistical systems meet users'
  needs, or in the case of a new statistical series potential users'
  needs. The development of a roadmap for statistical development can
  be guided by several tools and guidelines developed by PARIS21 based
  at OECD. \emph{Figure 1.1: Tools available to support establishing a
  business case} shows the sub-processes set out the GSBPM and
  indicates where tools are available for establishing a business
  case. These are discussed below.

\item
  Advocacy from regional and international authorities can play a
  crucial part in raising the priority given to refugee and IDP
  statistics by governments, planning authorities and chief
  statisticians. Effective advocacy includes explicitly documenting
  and specifying the unaddressed needs, targeting a group within the
  national statistical system that can effect change, proposing a
  detailed business case for closing the data gap, and using hard
  evidence as a basis for the business case. Joint approaches in
  strengthening national statistical systems, whether regional or
  international, have often been more effective than individual
  national efforts in capacity building and fundraising for emerging
  areas of official statistics, such as refugee and IDP statistics.
\item
  As the international statistical system derives its input from
  national statistical systems, establishing a business case for a new
  statistical series requires substantial planning and co-ordination
  at national and international levels alike. Nationally, the
  production of refugee and IDP statistics can require several
  ministries, departments or agencies to cooperate with the national
  statistics office (NSO) to make the resulting statistics fit for
  purpose and relevant to users (Eurostat, 2018).

  The IRRS and IRIS recommendations propose a list of basic data
  tabulations (IRRS Chapter 3 and IRIS Chapter 5) and indicators (IRRS
  Chapter 5 and IRIS Chapter 4) to be produced at the national level.
  These recommendations serve as the core set of official statistics
  in the displacement domain which includes refugee and related
  persons; and internally displaced persons. However, a country's
  range of statistics will vary, depending on the national policy
  priorities and the reporting requirements of regional international
  users, and the capacity of the National Statistical System and what
  statistics are possible to produce with a reasonable effort
\item
  In respect of international reporting obligations, it should be
  noted that the Inter-Agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators
  accepted the proposal of EGRIS members to recommend disaggregation
  by forced displacement categories for 12 priority SDG indicators, as
  well by age and sex whenever possible.\footnote{\textsuperscript{Ibid~para~94}} In order to ensure
  availability of minimum quality statistics on refugees and IDPs, it
  is recommended that national statistics providers include statistics
  on these priority indicators in the reporting plans for the 2030
  Agenda. However, governments should not feel limited to this
  priority list, and data collection on additional indicators is
  encouraged (IRIS, paragraph 130).
\item
  There are several potential users of statistics on displaced
  persons, including governments and national authorities, local
  authorities, international organisations, civil society, NGOs,
  researchers/academia, the media and the general public. They have
  different needs and priorities, requiring statistics for different
  purposes:

  for administrative purposes,

  for policymaking,
\item
  for monitoring the implementation of policies,
\item
  for evaluating policies,

  Identifying important ``needs gaps'' and users' priorities requires
  research. Which can involve a mixed-methods approach, using a
  combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods. A
  useful source of information on the needs of both displaced people
  and the agencies supporting them may be provided by needs
  assessments undertaken by or on behalf on operational agencies
  supporting refugees and IDPs. Needs assessments not only inform
  humanitarian partners but can inform those considering the data
  needs of those supporting the displaced. The UNHCR Needs Assessment
  Handbook provides guidance on their conduct (see also Phase 4
  references \emph{Phase Links and Examples of Training Manuals and Data
  Collection Advice)}. These needs assessments were promoted by the
  World Humanitarian Summit in 2016 and established "commitments for
  aid organizations and donors to work together efficiently,
  transparently, and harmoniously in order to better deliver
  protection and assistance to the millions of people facing emergency
  needs. One of these commitments calls for the improvement of needs
  assessments, notably by:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \item
    Providing a single, comprehensive, cross-sectoral,
    methodologically sound, and impartial overall assessment of
    needs for each crisis to inform strategic decisions;
  \item
    Coordinating and streamlining data collection to ensure
    compatibility, quality and comparability, and avoid
    over-assessment and duplication;
  \item
    sharing needs assessment data in a timely manner, with the
    appropriate mitigation of protection and privacy risks; and
  \item
    Prioritizing humanitarian response across sectors based on
    evidence established by the analysis.\footnote{Source IRRS:

  PARIS21 has developed the \href{https://adapt.paris21.org/auth/login}{Advanced Data Planning Tool
  (ADAPT)}\footnote{Output system is considered as a dissemination system (data
    portal, platform, database etc.) which is offered to external/end
    users of the statistical information/products.} for NSOs to adapt
  their data production processes to meet the data needs of users. It
  is a consultative tool, which brings data stakeholders together to
  identify data gaps, and define requirements within an established
  monitoring indicator framework such as the UN Sustainable
  Development Goals (SDGs) indicator framework or the basic statistics
  proposed by the IRIS and IRRS (see also the Sustainable Development
  Goal indicators website\footnote{\url{https://unstats.un.org/unsd/dnss/gp/fundprinciples.aspx}}.)
\item
  The results of ADAPT can contribute to the development of
  statistical plans, such as National Strategies for the Development
  of Statistics (NSDSs), and processes to strengthen the coordination
  of statistical planning at the national level. ADAPT offers three
  different options to identify indicators affiliated to a given
  statistical framework or specified topic, applicable to refugee and
  IDP statistics. Further details and an explanation of this tool can
  be found in PART III of the document (paragraph 739). Based on the
  information provided, the ADAPT tool can produce two main reports on
  the status of refugee and IDP statistics and identifies any data
  gaps at national level. The first report is able to summarise the
  status of refugee and IDP statistics in respect of the relevant
  national requirements, which could be based on the IRRS or IRIS
  tabulation indicator frameworks, or a national defined requirement.
  The second report presents the status of refugee and IDP statistics
  as a general domain of statistical production, considering all
  indicators that require a relevant disaggregation variable.

\setcounter{enumi}{30}
\item
  National collaboration platforms, for example targeted workshops or
  thematic conferences, and regional fora can be an opportunity to
  engage with the identified strategic stakeholders and promote the
  need for refugee and IDP statistics. Connecting the topics with
  policy priorities at international and national levels can attract
  the attendance of high-level political representatives and help to
  gain government support.
\item
  Many countries are mandated by their statistics law to set out a
  statistical work programme, an example of this is Turkstat whose
  Official Statistics Programme is based on the Statistics Law of
  Turkey No 5429. Many other countries have statistical development
  plans such as the NSDS described below.
\item
  \href{https://nsdsguidelines.paris21.org/node/717}{National Strategies for the Development of Statistics
  (NSDSs)} provide a
  framework for structuring support and developing statistical
  capacity in the national statistical system. These multi-annual
  strategies aim at mainstreaming sectors into the national
  statistical system (NSS), engaging with other data producers and
  coordinating the entire NSS, responding to data challenges, and
  building statistical capacity across the ``the statistical value
  chain'' (PARIS21, 2018). An NSDS can be an integral part of national
  ownership over statistical development, and secure funding at
  national and international level.
\item
  The implementation of refugee and IDP statistics in these
  statistical development plans, which cover all parts of official
  statistics, can be useful for mainstreaming these statistics into a
  wider national planning process and improving cooperation with the
  data producers involved. This is particularly important with
  displacement statistics as data is likely to be held by many
  agencies including non-traditional sources and the humanitarian
  sector.
\item
  The NSDS should be firmly linked to national development plans and
  involve several different sectors. Refugee and IDP statistics could
  be considered a sector. The identification of targeted sectors
  varies from country to country depending on national priorities and
  administrative structures. Usually, sectoral strategies correspond
  to line ministries, government departments or agencies with separate
  and well-defined areas of concern, mandate and budget. However, most
  countries do not have a corresponding government ministry or agency
  responsible for monitoring forced migration or displacement, and the
  level political sensitivity within these domains remains at a high
  level.
\item
  As part of the NSDS process, making the case for developing a
  sectoral strategy for refugee and IDP statistics is important.
  Traditionally in the NSDS process, technical committees are in
  charge of defining sectoral statistical needs, and the number of
  sectors involved is often constrained. Depending on its strategic
  importance to government, refugee and IDP statistics could face
  challenges in being ``recognised'' as a sectoral statistical area
  within the NSDS process and may require specific advocacy and the
  allocation of a lead government Ministry, Department or Agency.
\item
  Depending on whether the country has developed a NSDS or not, the
  mid-term evaluation or a new phase of the NSDS can be the right
  moment for integrating a new sectoral strategy related to refugee
  and IDP statistics. Integration of refugee and IDP statistics into
  the NSDS should occur at all stages of the design and implementation
  phases. The process of developing a sectoral strategy for refugee
  and IDP statistics involves the following steps:
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{establishing-a-sector-statistics-committee-for-displacement-statistics}{%
\subsubsection{Establishing a Sector Statistics Committee for Displacement Statistics}\label{establishing-a-sector-statistics-committee-for-displacement-statistics}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{37}
\item
  Sector Statistics Committees (SSC) are responsible for defining and
  confirming the statistical needs for sectors. The Refugee and IDP
  Statistics Committee should be constituted by those leading of the
  sector at the request of the NSO, and a sector Coordinator should be
  designated. A large number of departments, ministries and agencies
  could be involved, including migration authorities, social
  development ministries, urban planning authorities, rural
  development authorities, and the humanitarian sector. Experience
  shows that five active members are the ideal number for the
  committee, but the Sector Statistics Committee should involve actors
  from the wider data ecosystem and goes beyond the traditional
  boundaries of the NSS, to humanitarian agencies including UNHCR and
  OCHA.
\item
  The responsibilities of a potential Refugee and IDP Statistics
  Committee would be similar to those of other sectors, including: a)
  proposing a vision for refugee and IDP statistics for approval, b)
  prioritising statistical activities over the lifespan of the
  Sectoral Strategy for the Development of Statistics, c) identifying
  major agencies currently collecting relevant statistics for refugees
  and IDPs, d) preparing an inventory of existent current data systems
  in existence operated by stakeholders, e) identifying major data
  needs related to the sector, f) developing strategic actions,
  including organisational and HR development, IT strategy,
  dissemination policy and other areas.
\item
  The role of the NSO is important for statistics coordination and to
  ensure that the potential data sources relevant for refugee and
  displacement statistics are able to be used, and that data
  confidentiality is adequately protected under the relevant
  statistics law.
\item
  The sector statistics design team should consist of staff from
  several ministries (e.g.~Interior and External Relations Ministries,
  Migration agency) to ensure commitment and assurance of staff time
  through a more formal process, including memoranda of understanding
  between the agencies and participating ministries. As NSSs are not
  always able to capture forced migration and displacement within
  officially produced data sources, data may be needed from
  non-traditional data producing institutions, such as civil society
  and humanitarian agencies.

\setcounter{enumi}{41}
\item
  Where there is insufficient data from government sources for
  statistical purposes, operational data from humanitarian agencies
  present a possible resource for establishing or augmenting a new
  statistical series for refugee and IDP statistics. Operational data
  are produced during regular activities of humanitarian agencies are
  intended for internal use in planning operations only and do not
  usually meet the standards set for official statistics, before use
  they should be carefully assessed using a national or international
  statistical data (e.g.~UN Statistics \emph{Quality Assurance Framework
  quality assessment tool).}
\item
  The quality of any operational data identified for use in a new
  statistical series should be assessed focusing on standardisation,
  coverage, accuracy and confidentiality. Ultimately, the statistical
  authority (e.g.~NSO, line ministry, specialised statistical unit
  within NSS) in charge will determine the usefulness of operational
  data as input for the new statistical series after assessing crucial
  quality issues and negotiating data sharing agreements (see IRRS,
  Chapter 6 pp 136-140).
\item
  One source of operational data is the IASC Common Operational
  Datasets, are developed and endorsed by the Inter-agency Standing
  Committee (IASC) and disseminated by OCHA. These are Common
  Operational Data sets (CODs) and fundamental operational datasets
  (FODs) used in humanitarian emergencies to support technical
  standards, improve the quality of data, and strengthen
  interoperability. In the IASC Common Operational Datasets there are
  three levels of accountability: Guardian, Sponsor and Source. For
  more information see the \href{https://fscluster.org/sites/default/files/documents/IASC_Guidelines_on_Common_Operational_Datasets_in_Disaster_Preparedness_and_Response_1_Nov._2010\%5B1\%5D.pdf}{IASC Guidelines on Common Operational
  Datasets in Disaster Preparedness and
  Response}.
\item
  The Protection Information Management for Quality Protection
  Outcomes (PIM) Initiative\footnote{Source: PARIS21 NSDS guidelines on data dissemination:
    \url{https://nsdsguidelines.paris21.org/node/796}} is a collaborative project, bringing
  together UN, NGO, and other protection and IM partners working to
  respond to protection needs in situations of displacement. The
  objective of PIM is to provide quality data and information on
  people in displacement situations in a safe, reliable, and
  meaningful way. Data on refugees and IDPs can be extremely sensitive
  and confidentiality and data protection are of paramount importance.
  Data collection should be consistent with national legislation on
  data protection and international obligations related to privacy.
  Data protection considerations may limit the access of statisticians
  to information in administrative systems, unless national laws
  establish the right of access to administrative data for statistical
  purposes. This project identifies three different roles for the use
  of PIM data;

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \item
    \textbf{Guardian:} OCHA is the ``Guardian'' of the agreed upon datasets
    and will facilitate the distribution of the ``best'' available
    common operational and fundamental datasets in emergencies while
    managing forums for updates and distribution communication. If
    OCHA is unable to provide this service in a specific country, a
    suitable substitute Guardian should be identified by
    Humanitarian Country Teams or equivalent decision-making body
    during contingency planning. Quality assurance for compliance
    with minimum format and data characteristics in datasets will be
    conducted by OCHA, or the substitute Guardian, prior to
    distribution. This will include assigning a common GLIDE number
    to be associated with the dataset after the onset of a natural
    disaster\footnote{\url{http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/stats/publications/2018/ECECESSTAT20182.pdf}

  \item
    \textbf{Sponsor:} Each dataset has a designated ``Sponsor'' who is
    responsible for identifying and liaising with relevant ``Sources''
    to analyse, collate, clean and achieve consensus around a
    specific operational dataset If possible dataset Sponsors will
    proactively identify and collate information prior to
    emergencies in the data preparedness phase in support of the
    contingency planning process. If this is not possible, Sponsors
    will be identified in relation to their specific dataset early
    in the emergency and will assume responsibilities related to
    their thematic dataset. OCHA will maintain lists of dataset
    Sponsors at the country and global levels and coordinate between
    data Sponsors.
  \item
    \textbf{Source:} Each dataset will have designated source(s) or
    owner(s), such as: national authority/agency, Cluster, NGO, UN
    agency, International Organization, International Red Cross/Red
    Crescent that agrees to be fully responsible for the
    development, maintenance and metadata associated with a dataset
    and control distribution restrictions.

\item
  In many countries where governments have limited capacity to
  register refugees, the UNHCR collects administrative data on asylum
  seekers and refugees on behalf of governments. Part III of this
  manual includes an example of the data sharing Agreement on the
  Transfer of Personal Data of Refugees and Asylum-seekers to
  governments under certain conditions (see Part III \emph{UNHCR Agreements
  and Memoranda of} \emph{Understand}ing). They acknowledge the importance
  of registration as a protection tool and expect States to take
  responsibility for registration as quickly as possible. The sharing
  of data needs to be "\emph{subject to the data protection safeguards as
  contained in UNHCR's Policy on the Protection of Persons of
  Concern}\footnote{\url{https://nsdsguidelines.paris21.org/node/796}}\emph{".} The agreement allows for the \emph{'}compiling
  statistical data' among the allowable purposes for personal data
  transfer. Data may not be transferred to a third party except with
  the prior written authorisation of UNHCR and/or the consent of the
  data subject (the refugee or displaced person). Any third party must
  conform with the conditions set out in the UNHCR data sharing
  agreement. In the case of refugees, the data may not be shared with
  the refugee's country of origin, except under the circumstances of
  voluntary repatriation under the auspices of UNHCR with the consent
  of the individual refugee.
\item
  The minimum set of indicators identified in the IRRS and IRIS
  recommendations should be considered as the core statistics to
  monitor internal and international displacement and for reporting to
  the global statistical system. However, it is recognised that most
  countries will not reach this minimum initially, and that time will
  be needed to build the capacity to produce these.

  Once a need has been established, the practicalities of developing
  the statistical series will have to be defined. Establishing the
  practicalities include the agreement of users on the suitability of
  and quality measures for the proposed statistical outputs, and the
  recommendation of indicators and levels of disaggregation.
  Furthermore, this sub-process can be used to address any special
  concerns of refugees and IDP through the statistical series that
  could be relevant in the national context (trauma, sensitivity,
  confidentiality, migrating children etc.).
\item
  There are inherent potential risks of producing displacement
  statistics, as data use would include politically sensitive issues
  such as refugee support, population displacement, integration,
  disaster response and crossing borders. Any data collection effort
  in these domains needs to observe people`s rights to consent,
  privacy, security and ownership, and consider legal frameworks
  relating to confidentiality, which are both likely to be constraints
  when defining the output objectives.

  An internationally agreed refugee and related persons classification
  was agreed in the IRRS 2018 (see Chapter 3) and a similar
  classification for IDPs is set out in IRIS 2020 (see Chapter 3).
  When referring to the refugee population within a given country, the
  IRRS include persons who are ``primarily classified in legal terms by
  their claim to refugee status, or their descent from those with or
  seeking international protection'' (IRRS, 2018). There are three
  major categories; a) Persons in need of international protection
  which includes refugees, asylum seekers and others granted temporary
  or subsidiary forms of protection; b) Persons with a refugee
  background which includes naturalized former refugees, the children
  and other family members of refugees, and c) Persons returned from
  abroad after seeking international protection. (see IRRS Figure 3.1
  page 30).
\item
  For IDPs and related populations there are four major categories; a)
  Persons who have displacement-related protection needs (subdivided
  into IDPs in locations of displacement, IDPs in location of return,
  and IDPs in other settlement locations); b) IDP-related populations
  who are the children born after displacement to at least one IDP
  parent; c) Other non-displaced family members of IDPs; and d) Those
  who have overcome key displacement-related vulnerabilities. (See
  IRIS Figure 3.1 page 26).
\item
  From the point of view of the statistics users, nationally and
  internationally, classificatory differences between national laws
  and international recommendations may be identified. These
  differences may reflect the specific needs of data users. If the
  concepts do not align, the stakeholder should agree on a process to
  approach conformity, and any remaining differences need to clearly
  be identified in the accompanying metadata.

  Classificatory differences mainly may arise due to differences in
  national legislation and it may be required to add the reasons for
  granting asylum. The reference metadata for a new statistical series
  on refugee statistics should pay special attention to describing and
  defining these differences to achieve international comparability of
  refugee statistics. The structure of the reference metadata should
  follow established statistical standards, such as Statistical Data
  and Metadata eXchange (SDMX)\footnote{Source:

\item
  The production of refugee and IDP statistics often requires the
  combination of data from several data producers within the national
  statistical system, including line ministries, government
  departments and agencies, and civil society. As national statistical
  systems differ in their level of centralization, the effort needed
  to foster consultation and collaboration between statistical
  producers varies accordingly. Therefore, establishing a statistical
  programme of work, developed jointly by the statistical producers,
  requires an initial mapping of strategic stakeholders to be
  consulted in the consultation for and the confirmation of the
  business case.
\item
  Accessing data produced by the agencies responsible for displaced
  people for statistical use can be problematic. There are a number of
  reasons why data sharing between agencies for statistical purposes
  can be difficult. These involve legal restrictions and issues of
  trust between officials. While the statistics law is usually clear
  about data confidentiality and the uses to which data can be put,
  the agency collecting the data will also have its own laws and
  regulations which may prohibit data sharing, and the issue becomes
  one of legal precedence. The situation in the European Statistical
  System as at 2015-2017 is set out below in \emph{Table 1.2: National
  Legal Framework - Clarity and coverage of legislation; restrictions
  and limitations. (European Statistical System).}
\item
  Member States of the European Union and EFTA have statistics laws
  which enables data sharing among government stakeholders. This legal
  framework authorises the NSOs to access administrative sources
  without imposing any restrictions with reference to the provisions
  laid down in the \href{https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:087:0164:0173:En:PDF}{Regulation (EC)
  223/2009}.
  In this regulation \emph{Article 24, Access to administrative records}
  states;

  \emph{``In order to reduce the burden on respondents, the NSIs and other
  national authorities and the Commission (Eurostat) shall have access
  to administrative data sources, from within their respective public
  administrative system, to the extent that these data are necessary
  for the development, production and dissemination of European
  statistics.'' }
\item
  The~\href{http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/ess/about-us/ess-vision-2020}{ESS Vision
  2020}~highlights
  the importance of cooperation with stakeholders and of developing
  strategic alliances with private and public partners (key area
  "identifying user needs and cooperation with stakeholders"). A
  workshop was organised in 2016 in order to allow the National
  Statistical Institutes to identify and share best practices on
  cooperating with the owners of administrative sources in order to
  access to administrative data sources (\href{https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cros/content/2016-workshop-access-administrative-sources_en}{Workshop on Access to
  Administrative Data
  Sources},
  Brussels, 13-14 September 2016). Between 2015 and 2017, information
  was collected on the obstacles that the NSOs still face in accessing
  administrative data and how they have managed to overcome some of
  the difficulties. On this basis, two reports were finalised in 2018:

\item
  The in-flow tabulations distinguish between a) IDPs with protection
  needs and b) IDP-related populations. Capturing flows may be
  difficult and challenging for national statistical systems depending
  on the data collection methodology used. The flows of IDPs are more
  complex to estimate than the flows of refugees, as the ending of IDP
  status is not legally defined in international law as is the case
  for refugees. IDP status ceases when a durable solution has been
  reached, and this can only be achieved if displacement related
  vulnerabilities have been overcome according to the IASC framework
  on durable solutions (see IRIS, 2020 Chapter 4).
\item
  The IRIS proposes a methodology to measure the progress that IDPs
  have made in overcoming key displacement-related vulnerabilities,
  and to assess statistically when IDPs have reached a durable
  solution and can be taken out of the IDP stock. The methodology is
  to be tested in a variety of contexts and will be amended to take
  account of country conditions.

  Most of the variables to be used are common to other areas of social

  background ae unique, and more detail can be found in IRRS
  Chapter 3. These variables required are set out in below in \emph{Table
  2.9: Variables for refugee statistics}.
\item
  Variable xi in the table, \emph{Legal residential/international
  protection status as applicable to the national context} in the
  table refers to the persons legal status in respect of international
  protection. The classification is set out in IRRS (2018) Figure 3.1
  and reproduced here in \emph{Table 2.10: Classification of legal
  protection status of refugees and refugee related populations.}
\item
  Another variable that is unique to displacement statistics is linked
  to the legal concept of place or country of habitual residence. This
  refers to the place or country where a person was usually resident
  at the time they were displaced. This concept occurs in variable
  viii listed below for refugee statistics and in IDP statistics.
\item
  The usual place or country of residence is where a person is living
  now, and has been or intends to continue living for one year. The
  habitual place of residence is the place or country from where the
  person was displaced. IRIS (2020) Box 3.3 describes the differences.
  The concepts are equally applicable to country and place of
  residence. The concept is used in the \emph{Bosnia and Herzegovina Case
  Study} (see paragraph \emph{537 onwards)} and captures the address before
  the war and the current address in its Database of Displaced Persons
  (DDPR). Georgia asks in its census ``Where are you a refugee from''

  includes the date of first and last displacement. The reason for
  displacement is required in a more extensive form, and the type of
  dwelling or habitation they are currently living in is also
  required. In order to identify the IDP-related population the IDP
  status of parents is also required.
\end{enumerate}

Table 2.11: Variables for IDP statistics

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{79}
\item
  Variables vii and viii are used to assess whether or not individuals
  have returned to their habitual place of residence. This return
  enables the IDP to be classified according to the three sub-stocks
  (see IRIS, 2020 Figure 3.1 - i. IDPs in locations of
  displacement, ii. IDPs in locations of return, and iii. IDPs in
  other settlement locations) and to be counted as flow within the
  stock.
\item
  As a simple return does not mean that IDPs have overcome all their
  displacement related vulnerabilities, additional variables will be
  needed to assess the IDPs progress and to contribute to the
  composite measure to assess overcoming key displacement-related
  vulnerabilities. The \emph{Criteria and sub-criteria included in the
  Composite Measure of Overcoming Displacement-Related
  Vulnerabilities} is explained in the IRIS Chapter 4 and is
  illustrated in Figure 4.3 reproduced below. The same chapter
  discusses the choice of the variables to be used, and future
  progress on recommendations made will be included in future versions
  of this Manual.
\item
  Therefore, in addition to classificatory variables described above,
  a set of variables should be chosen to assess the IDPs progress
  towards overcoming their displacement related vulnerabilities.
  \emph{Table 2.12: Criteria and sub-criteria included in the composite
  measure of overcoming displacement-related vulnerabilities} lists
  the criteria.
\item
  To make the assessment of the progress of the IDP and IDP-related
  population a comparator population is needed, this may be the
  general population or sub-national population in the vicinity of the
  initial displacement who have not themselves suffered displacement.
  These variables should also be available in the comparator
  population where relevant to enable comparisons to be made.

  For each sub-criterion, there are many different indicators which
  can be chosen, although a final list has not yet been agreed. The
  indicators selected in each national context should, as far as
  possible, be aligned with already tested and standardized
  indicators. The Durable Solutions indicator library\footnote{Source IRRS:
    \url{https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/3859598/9315869/KS-GQ-18-004-EN-N.pdf/d331c9cc-1091-43c2-b589-2c250bccc281}
    - page 125.} provides a
  thorough overview of potential options (see IRIS,2020 paragraph
  127-128). Where relevant, they should also mirror the SDG indicators
  recommended to be disaggregated by different categories of
  displacement. Indicators selected should be carefully chosen to
  ensure they are relevant for all three sub-stocks of the displaced
  population: IDPs in locations of displacement, IDPs in locations of
  return and IDPs in other settlement locations.
\item
  For the purposes of statistical measurement, to make it as unbiased
  and cost efficient as possible, the following aspects should be
  taken into account when selecting the indicators:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \setcounter{enumii}{5}
  \item
    Commonly used: It is an advantage if the indicator in question
    is collected for other purposes as well to facilitate population
    group comparison and to incorporate displacement analysis into
    existing larger data collection processes. SDG indicators are a
    good example here as most surveys and censuses will cover a
    number of these at least up until 2030.
  \item
    Tested and evaluated. Linked to the previous point, it is also
    an advantage to select indicators or questions which have been
    tested and satisfy quality criteria. This is the case for most
    of the indicators and related questions asked in standard
    household surveys, for example on education, food security or
    employment.
  \item
    Covering the population in question: There are several potential
    indicators which may be relevant in the context, but do not
    cover all of the population in question.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  This manual discusses four types of data sources: A. Census of
  Population and Housing, B. Sample Surveys, C. Administrative Data
  and D. Integrated Data Sources. Each of these data sources is
  described in turn, and subprocesses 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5 are separately
  described for each of the sources where relevant.
\item
  The design of the data collection should at a minimum aim to collect
  data to populate the variables described above in sub-phase 2.2.
  Design variable descriptions. In many cases the data collection
  exercise will need to identify both the refugee and related
  populations, and the IDP and related populations. Compromises may
  need to be made to keep the questioning to manageable proportions.

\item
  The IRRS, 2018 includes a recommendation on identifying refugees in
  the population census, by asking about the main reason for the
  immigration to the country and allowing for an option on forced
  displacement. If internal migration is also included in a census,
  then there is the potential to screen for IDPs as well as refugees
  by asking similar questions on the reason for internal moves within
  a country. Typically, a census asks about a person's location a year
  ago, and in some cases 5 years ago. Where there have been large
  displacements in a country the date selected often coincides with a
  significant displacement event, as this not only helps people to
  recall where they were on the date chosen improving accuracy, but
  also helps to identify IDPs.
\item
  The IRIS, 2020 also make census recommendations. Recognising that
  relying on internal migration questions in a census is likely to
  lead to an under-estimation of IDP stocks because the last move of
  an IDP is not always the most relevant one. The limitations are as
  follows;

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \setcounter{enumii}{10}
  \item
    Place of habitual residence will usually not be identified,
  \item
    Those who have returned to their habitual place of residence
    within the period specified by the census,
  \item
    Those who within the period specified by the census have moved
    one or several times after their initial displacement, and
  \item
    Those who have moved within the same administrative area used in
    census geographical classifications.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  Ideally every census would ask questions about the reasons for both
  internal and international migration and include a response on
  forced displacement. This would capture IDPs, refugees, asylum
  seekers, those under temporary protection and those returning to
  their country of habitual residence. The reason should refer to the
  main reason for the most recent move. The question should be asked
  of all individuals, not just adults and also be asked to those
  living in camps and other temporary accommodation. Camps are often
  treated as institutional buildings and respondents are asked a brief
  subset of questions which are unsuitable for identifying displaced
  people.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Institutional questionnaires}\label{institutional-questionnaires}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{91}
\item
  In many censuses there are several questionnaire forms, there is
  usually one form for a private household and another for
  `institutional establishments'. These institutions often comprise
  schools, hospitals, hotels, workers camps and so on. They may also
  be used to cover camps for IDPs or refugees. Institutional
  questionnaires may not be suitable for camps for the displaced,
  particularly where these are more than short term arrangements. As
  the question content is often much shorter in the institutional
  questionnaire than in the household questionnaire, the information
  will be insufficient to provide for the requirements of users
  interested in displaced people. Wherever possible the camps should
  be enumerated using the questionnaires designed for private
  households.
\item
  It may also be possible to distinguish the type of camp and to
  record that on the questionnaire forms. The type of living quarter
  as recommended by the UN/ECE manual is a single response question
  including alternatives for ``Refugee camp'' and ``IDP'' camp. Use of
  this question makes it possible to distinguish between IDPs and
  Refugees, and ``camp dwellers''.

\item
  If it is important to capture the entire IDP population a specific
  set of questions on forced displacement could be asked, but this is
  only likely to be justifiable in cases where there have been major
  national displacements and where;

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \setcounter{enumii}{14}
  \item
    IDPs have started to return to their places of habitual
    residence and it is expected that they still have key
    displacement related vulnerabilities,
  \item
    IDPs are expected to have settled elsewhere after their initial
    displacement, but still have key displacement related
    vulnerabilities,
  \item
    Multiple forced displacements have occurred to the same
    population,
  \item
    Displacements are expected to have happened within the smallest
    administrative area proposed by the census, or
  \item
    Displacement might be for a combination of these reasons.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  The IRIS, 2020 recommends a set of questions for identifying IDPs
  and/or refugees in contexts where users require a more complete
  estimate of stocks and flows than is likely to be obtained from
  using regular internal migration census questions.

  Has *(NAME) ever been forced to flee? (adding reason)

  If yes;
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  When was this?
\item
  Where did you move from?
\item
  Where did you reside before you were forcibly displaced?
\item
  Where did you move to? (Within country borders/abroad)?

  The UNECE makes recommendations for the 2020 Population Census round
  which cover many of the core variables required to screen the
  population for Refugees (♥) and IDPs (♣), although several of the
  items are non-core topics which are at the discretion of countries
  to add. The reason for migration, both international and internal,
  would need to include an answer category which includes the concept
  of forced migration. The UNECE recommendation on the reason for
  international migration is '\emph{admittance for humanitarian or
  political reasons}.
\item
  The UNECE document also provides a definition of the population
  group "\emph{Population with a refugee background".} The definition of
  this population group includes:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{quote}
"(a)~Persons who declared that their main reason for migration
international migration was `forced migration.' Some examples of
categories that would qualify as `forced migration' are; armed
conflict, situations of general violence, violations of human rights,
natural or human-made disasters.

(b) ~Foreign-born persons who declared that their main reason for
migration was `Family' and are members of the same family nucleus of a
person in group (a).

(c) ~Native-born children members of the same family nucleus of the
parents and having both parents in group (a) or one parent in the group
(a) and the other parent of the group (b)."
\end{quote}

Table 2.14: UNECE recommendations in the 2020 Population Census round

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{97}
\item
  The UNECE recommendations cover IDPs as a non-core topic in the
  internal migration section, which is defined as ``\emph{Internal migrants,
  as identified in the census, are, therefore, specifically defined as
  those who are usually resident in a civil division at the} \emph{census
  reference time and who have previously been resident in another
  civil division within the country}''. This is slightly problematic
  for IDPs who need not cross an administrative boundary in order to
  quality as an IDP (IRIS, 2020 paragraph 115). To capture these IDPs
  who do not move administrative areas a direct question about
  displacement may be required for all individuals (see above 49).
\item
  In paragraph 689 of the UNECE Recommendations\footnote{Output system is considered as a dissemination system (data
    portal, platform, database etc.) which is offered to external/end
    users of the statistical information/products.} ``Internally
  Displaced Persons (IDPs) are defined as nationals or citizens who
  were `forced migrants' within their country of residence together
  with their dependents living in the same household at the census
  reference time, including children born after the forced migration
  took place''. This differs from these recommendations, as family
  members who were not themselves displaced are not treated as IDPs,
  although children with at least one IDP parent are allocated to the
  category `IDP-related'.

  Many countries have already taken steps towards identifying
  refugees. In the 2010 census round, there were 14 countries that
  asked questions on residents' status, including refugee status.
  Details of the types on questions asked can be found in \emph{Table 2.15:
  Refugee questions in selected censuses of population and housing}
  below, and in Table 4.1 in IRRS.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Morocco and Algeria had special questionnaires for their nomadic
  population.
\item
  35 countries asked the question `reason for migration' and 14
  countries provided response options referring to ``involuntary
  return'', or ``displacement''.
\item
  Census data from Kenya 2009 census include conventional households,
  unconventional households (i.e.~group quarters and those included in
  special populations), and households in refugee camps.
\item
  Bosnia and Herzegovina (see Case Study Part II of this Manual,
  paragraph 546) includes questions about citizenship, displacement
  and return. It asks about residence at the time of the 1991 census
  which took place a year before the armed conflict in the country.
\item
  Cameroon collected information on refugees and IDPs in its fourth
  General census of Population and Housing (see Case Study Part II of
  this Manual, paragraph 553 onwards).
\item
  Georgia during its 2014 General Population Census asks directly
  about IDP or refugee status and asks about previous place or country
  or residence (see Case Study Part II of this Manual, paragraph 579
  onwards).

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{101}
\item
  A hybrid census produces population estimates for small areas or
  for uniform, detailed grids in the absence of a traditional national
  census. Hybrid censuses rely on complete counts of population within
  small, defined areas, through `micro-census surveys' selected across
  an area. These data are collected relatively rapidly and at a
  fraction of the cost of a full national census. Statistical models
  are then used to link these micro-census data to spatial data with
  full coverage to predict population numbers in the unsampled
  locations. Population totals can also be produced for administrative
  units or for the national level by aggregating these high-resolution
  predictions.
\item
  This approach can never replace the data generated by a traditional
  population and housing census, which provides full coverage of data
  on individuals, families, households and communities. However, where
  a traditional census cannot be fully executed in all locations of a
  country due to insecurity or other concerns, then this hybrid
  approach can produce population estimates for small areas in the
  absence of traditional census data.
\item
  Population data for a sample of areas across the area or country
  are needed as a primary input for a hybrid census. These data may
  come from a partial census, a census-like population survey or a
  specifically designed micro-census survey. Robust geo-referencing of
  the geographical areas where population data has been acquired is
  also a requirement.
\item
  The design must capture the range of population densities,
  demographics and environmental dimensions that exist across the
  area. Enumeration can be conducted within administrative units or
  within other arbitrarily designed polygons, as long as the
  population data is explicitly linked to the correct geographical
  area. Global Positioning Systems (GPS) can be used to ensure
  enumeration is occurring in the correct location, and the inclusion
  of GPS technology in smart phones and tablet computers can integrate
  navigation and the recording of geographical coordinates into
  enumeration activities, minimising locational error and human
  effort. Depending on the questions included in the micro-census,
  disaggregation for certain population groups can be achieved.
\item
  There are several limitations to the approach:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{verbatim}
20. Micro-census data must be collected with the same care and rigor
    as a full census.

21. Population data are highly political and contentious, affecting
    all per capita rate estimates, shifting political representation
    and changing claims to power or resources. Conflicts,
    environmental hazards, or large population displacements make it
    difficult to accurately collect information on the dynamic
    population, and misrepresenting populations at risk should be
    avoided.
\end{verbatim}

Box 2.2: Afghanistan hybrid census

\begin{quote}
The last population census in Afghanistan was conducted in 1979 and a new census is not foreseen until after 2020.
To fill this gap, UNFPA, Flowminder/WorldPop and the Afghanistan National Statistical Office have worked together to develop an innovative methodology to estimate subnational population counts.
By combining survey, GIS and satellite data into a statistical model to predict numbers in areas where no population data were available, it was possible to generate high resolution maps of population estimates disaggregated by age and sex, together with uncertainty metrics. The data will be used to support decision making and the measurement of the 98 SDG indicators that require population data. The collaboration has also contributed to further strengthening capacities of the Central Statistics Office and other related government agencies to generate population estimates based on the integration of geospatial data and ground surveys.

  In order to ensure coverage of refugee and IDP population in a

  in times of displacement. A very useful method is to collect data
  from mobile phones using call connection records. From there we can
  have up to date information about sudden changes of population
  density in small areas. With this method it is possible to have also
  a picture for the size of the new refugee or IDP settlement which
  can help in planning census operations.

\begin{enumerate}

\setcounter{enumi}{107}
\item
  Assessing the quality of population and housing census data is an
  integral part of the census operation. UNFPA advocates for more
  countries to carry out some sort of quality assessment exercise. The
  Post Enumeration Survey (PES) of a Population Census is a sample
  survey that evaluates the results of the Census with regard to
  potential underestimation or overestimation of the size of the
  permanent population as well as to the capturing of the
  characteristics of the population.
\item
  Of the 134 countries or territories responding to a UN Statistics
  Division (UNSD) questionnaire on census implementation in the 2010
  census round, 89 had conducted a PES to evaluate the coverage of the
  census; among them 75\% used the PES to evaluate content errors. In
  Africa, Asia and South America, 78\% of countries undertook a PES,
  compared to only 40\% of countries in Oceania. One third of the
  countries implementing a PES used the results to adjust census
  figures.
\item
  Any census Post Enumeration Survey should look at the coverage of
  refugees and IDPs and the accuracy of data collected about them. To
  do this it is essential to carry out the PES in refugee camps,
  shelters, rented homes or any other institutional or other places
  where refugees and IDPs may be staying. Special attention must be
  paid for the demographic characteristics and the refugee status of
  the persons concerned. This may need a special design component
  within the PES
\item
  Such assessments need to consider two kinds of quality measures,
  namely:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{verbatim}
22. Census coverage: This is the percentage of actual
    population/households enumerated. The most common problem is
    under-coverage. Although with populations on the move
    over-coverage is also possible. Over-coverage also happens, if
    local authorities, with an interest in exaggerating their
    populations, are able to influence the data collection. An
    aggregate undercount of 3 to 6% is considered acceptable, but
    some population groups tend to be disproportionately affected,
    e.g. children under low age, young mobile men and undocumented
    migrants.

23. Content errors: This is the extent of incorrect answers for some
    key variables. Individual data are often provided by an
    informant (the head of household or other adult household
    member) who may not know all the details regarding each person.
    The household members themselves may be unsure or misunderstand
    the question. They may also hide or distort information on
    purpose. As a result, data quality may be poor, despite
    excellent coverage.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{111}
\tightlist
\item
  There are several methods for quality assessment. Content errors
  can often be detected through internal consistency analysis.
  Inconsistencies (e.g.~between children's ages and educational
  status, or young girls' ages and number of children, etc.) indicate
  poor data quality. But not all errors lead to inconsistencies.

\setcounter{enumi}{112}

\item
  Depending on the design of the PES sample, the household
  identification can be more or less rigorous. The following designs
  can be considered:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{verbatim}
i.  The PES sample consists of census enumeration areas that are
    completely re-enumerated in the PES. This design requires
    sufficient cases to provide results for relevant sub-samples
    including displaced people). It is easier to administer than the
    other options and reduces the travel time taken by enumerators.
    There are several requirements for this kind of PES; the
    enumeration areas must be well defined, with explicit
    geographical boundaries, based on good census cartography;
    out-of-area enumeration in the census should be almost
    non-existent; and the interval between the census and the PES
    should be very short (1-3 months).

ii. The PES sample consists of a larger number of census enumeration
    areas in each of which a certain fraction of households is
    sampled.

iii. The PES sample contains no clusters, but simply re-enumerates
    every n-th household from a newly produced national household
    listing. This design is efficient from a sampling viewpoint, but
    it is difficult to administer.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{113}
\tightlist
\item
  To apply designs ii) or iii) it is essential to use a rigorous
  household identification system. In its absence, design i) is the
  only viable option and even this may be challenging if the
  conditions listed above are not satisfied.
\end{enumerate}

\item
  A specific subject that requires planning and attention is how to
  deal with any changes in the situation of the households, that could
  be as a result of forced displacement. This displacement may have
  occurred between the census and the PES, and may impact on the
  household's composition. Specific questions have to be included in
  the PES that allow the detection of such changes, taking either the
  census or the PES as a base line. If the PES is taken as a base
  line, a code has to be included for each household member to
  indicate whether (s)he:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{verbatim}
i.  Was also present in this household and dwelling at census time;

ii. Was temporarily absent from the household and dwelling at census
    > time;

iii. Was born after the census; or

iv. Resided in a different household and dwelling at the time of the
    > census.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{115}
\tightlist
\item
  Note that iv) also includes the situation in which the entire
  household has moved from one physical dwelling to another. In
  cases ii) and iv), it may be wise to ask if the person was
  enumerated at the place where he or she spent census night. In
  addition, it must be verified if any residents at the census time
  have:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{verbatim}
i.  Died since then; or

ii. Become residents of a different household and dwelling since
    > then.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{116}
\item
  If the census is taken as a base line, the entire PES questionnaire
  has to be filled out according to the situation at census time and
  any changes have to be justified in terms of births, deaths and
  migrations, or changes of physical dwelling.
\item
  Although the number of changes should be small, especially if the
  PES is carried out very soon after the census, correctly classifying
  them can be time-consuming, especially if the information is found
  to be inconsistent at the time of matching. Take the case of a
  household member who is declared in the PES as having been
  temporarily absent from the household at census time, but who is
  present in the household at the time of the PES (alternative ii).
  The following possibilities exist:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{verbatim}
i.  The person was declared as member of the household at census
    time and the census was organized according to the de jure
    criterion. This would be correct. The best practice (which is
    not attainable in countries without well-defined postal
    addresses) is to verify the census records of the place where
    this person was at census time to check if (s)he was enumerated
    there, to detect any potential double counting.

ii. The person was declared as member of the household at census
    time and the census was de facto. This would be wrong. If the
    person was also enumerated at the place where (s)he spent census
    night, it would be a case of double counting. If not, it would
    be a classification error.

iii. The person was not declared as a household member at census
    time and the census was organized according to the de jure
    criterion. Depending on the person's enumeration status in the
    place where (s)he was at census time, it would be a
    classification error or an omission.

iv. The person was not declared as a household member at census time
    and the census was de facto. This would be correct. But in this
    case, it would be particularly important to verify if (s)he was
    enumerated elsewhere.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{118}
\item
  Deciding whether a person was enumerated elsewhere in the census
  also arises if the person permanently resided elsewhere at census
  time. The best information obtainable in this case may be based on
  his/her answer to the question, but verification may be impossible
  in all but the most sophisticated PES operations.
\item
  A slightly different situation presents itself in the case of
  persons who moved out of the household and dwelling after the
  census. In theory the PES should try to locate these individuals, to
  obtain their answers to the PES, to compare it to the census.
  Countries with a long history and high level of technical expertise
  in PES execution, such as Australia, actually collect this
  information. But in the PES processes of most developing countries
  this is impossible, and one has to assume that the PES data of such
  persons coincide with what they declared in the census.

\item
  There are several examples of methodologies for collecting refugee
  statistics from household surveys. There are two possible
  methodologies, the first is to design a specialist refugee survey,
  which could be part of a migrant survey and example of this is the
  \href{https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/european-neighbourhood-policy/enp-south/med-hims}{MED-HIMS
  survey}
  (see also Case Study in Part II of this Manual) designed for
  Mediterranean countries; the second is to include refugee screening
  questions in a more general household survey such as a Labour Force
  or Living Conditions Survey. The \href{https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/1978984/6037334/Model-questionnaire-LFS-AHM-2014.pdf}{European Union Labour Force Survey
  had a special module in
  2014}
  designed to collect data on the labour market situation of migrants
  and their descendants and includes questions to identify and
  describe the situation of refugees and asylum seekers. It asks if
  respondents migrated as a \emph{refugee or seeking international
  protection} in the previous 10 years and about obstacles to
  participating and integrating in the labour market.
\item
  Where data on stocks and flows, and comparisons with the living
  conditions of other groups in the population are required, then
  screening questions on a regular survey may be the most
  cost-effective methodology. This will depend on the incidence and
  distribution of the refugee and refugee-related population in the
  country and will require the input of a specialist sampling expert
  to determine if adequate samples of the target population of refuges
  are likely to be obtained.
\item
  Where detailed information about refugees and related populations
  is required, then a specialist survey may be the preferred option,
  but this likely to expensive and carried out rather infrequently. It
  also depends on having a good quality sampling frame from which to
  draw the sample.

Box 2.3: Jordan: The living conditions of Syrian refugees in Jordan:
Results from the 2017-2018 survey of Syrian refugees inside and outside
camps

\begin{quote}
Drawing on a survey implemented by the Department of Statistics (DoS) between November 2017 and January 2018, the report presents recent statistics on Syrian refugees residing in Jordan. It presents findings for six geographic localities: Amman; Zarqa; Irbid; Mafraq; the other governorates taken together; and the refugee camps.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
The report is based on information from 7,632 households and 40,950 individuals. Sampling was based on the DoS sampling frame constructed on the 2015 population census. A total of 1,121 clusters (locations) outside camps and 82 clusters inside camps were randomly selected. The sampling design was not geared towards estimating the number of Syrian refugees in the Hashemite Kingdom, but instead aimed for efficiency with regard to describing the Syrian refugee population in accordance with project objectives.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
A household is defined as a unit that pools its resources together, and whose members usually sleep and eat (most meals) together. Usually, the household members are immediate or more distant relatives, but they do not have to be related. This report defines a refugee household as one where the head of household is a Syrian refugee. It understands a Syrian refugee to be any Syrian individual who fled to Jordan from Syria as a consequence of the crisis and war there and arrived in Jordan after 15 March 2011, and who acknowledges or defines him- or herself as a refugee; any Syrian national who resided in Jordan before 15 March 2011 and became a refugee because he or she could not return to Syria; or any children of these two categories of people born after 15 March 2011. The vast majority of these self-ascribed Syrian refugees, 97 per cent, have formalized their refugee status by registering with the UNHCR.

  a core module will be developed and proposed as a standard approach
  for periodic use in existing national multi-topic household surveys
  such as the Living Standards Measurement Survey (LSMS), Demographic
  Health Survey (DHS), Multiple Indicators Cluster Surveys (MICS) or
  other multi-purpose surveys.
\item
  In order to maximize the quality, utility and comparability of data
  collected globally, it is recommended that the model questionnaire
  to be recommended is used to develop, design and test national
  survey instruments, particularly related to questions on key
  displacement related vulnerabilities. Maintaining consistency in
  questions over time also allows for the creation of time-series for
  IDP statistics.
\item
  There is some recent research work on methodologies improving the
  estimates of consumption obtained from displaced households and
  avoiding misreporting.
\end{enumerate}

"Indeed, survey respondents in IDP camps may believe that their
responses will influence the provision of humanitarian aid and will thus
misreport consumption in an attempt to influence its distribution. If
survey respondents are underreporting, the inaccuracies generated in the
data are highly problematic. At best, it makes the data spurious and
unusable. At worst, it could lead to misallocations of aid, from more
vulnerable areas to less vulnerable areas, or from solutions emphasizing
sustainability to immediate relief when immediate relief is unnecessary.
Given this context, light touch adaptations to the design of the survey
that prime the idea of honesty offer to make big improvements to the
quality of the data and support provisions the data informs.\footnote{\url{https://unstats.un.org/unsd/dnss/gp/fundprinciples.aspx}}

\subsubsection{Design Frame}\label{design-frame-1}}

"This only applies to processes which involve data collection based on
sampling, such as statistical surveys. It identifies and specifies the
population of interest, defines a sampling frame (and, where necessary,
the register from which it is derived), and determines the most
appropriate sampling criteria and methodology (which could include
complete enumeration).

Common sources for a sampling frame are administrative and statistical
registers, censuses and information from other sample surveys. This
sub-process describes how these sources can be combined if needed.
Analysis of whether the frame covers the target population should be
performed. A sampling plan should be made: The actual sample is created
in sub-process 4.1 (Create frame and select sample), using the
methodology, specified in this sub-process". (UNECE, 2013)

\hypertarget{b.1.-sampling-frames}{%
\paragraph{Sampling Frames}\label{b.1.-sampling-frames}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{130}
\item
  A sample is a subset of units drawn from the target population of
  interest. It is not usually convenient, efficient or possible to
  examine every member of an entire population. Sampling reduces the
  resources needed and, if done properly, provides estimates of the
  population characteristics with known accuracy. Sampling is the
  process of selecting units (e.g., households or individuals) from a
  population of interest so that by studying the sample we may
  generalize our results back to the population from which units were
  selected.
\item
  Sampling design describes how the final sampling units are selected
  and reached for the study. It is determined by the substantive goals
  of the study, and by resource and logistical constraints. There are
  different forms of designs in sampling.
\item
  Probability-based sampling ensures that every unit in the
  population has a known chance (greater than zero) of being selected
  in the sample, and its probability of selection can be accurately
  determined. This makes it possible to produce unbiased estimates of
  population totals, by weighting sampled units according to their
  probability of selection.
\item
  Non-probability-based sampling is any sampling method where we do
  not know the chance respondents have to be selected to the sample.
  In most cases some elements of the population have no chance of
  selection because the sampling strategy is based on decisions
  related to convenience, quotas or deliberate choice of elements of
  the population. In these cases, the probability of selection cannot
  be determined. Because the selection of elements is non-random,
  non-probability-based sampling does not allow the estimation of
  sampling errors, and it is not possible to assume that biases cancel
  each other out. When using non-probability based sampling the
  ability of making inferences about the population is limited, and
  the information generated needs to be treated carefully. Some
  adaptations of non-probability-based sampling have been made to
  allow for limited inferences. An example of this is
  Respondent-Driven Sampling, (RDS) or Snowball Sampling that propose
  ways of estimating weights to try to account for biases. See the
  example below from Turkey of a two-stage sampling methodology
  combining spatial and respondent driven sampling.
\item
  There are sampling constraints which should be considered when
  designing a sample survey of displaced persons. Displaced people may
  be a small proportion of the population, and it is likely that they
  live in specific locations and are not evenly distributed around the
  country or region. Any sample must be of a sufficient size and
  design to yield reliable results. Each survey has its own sampling
  design, even if it is similar from most national household surveys.
  Using the sampling design for an existing national survey will
  introduce a selection bias, if it is not amended to take account of
  the living circumstances of displaced people. Refugees and IDPs can
  live either in camps specially designated for displaced people or
  they can live in houses among the general population, either as part
  of another household or as an independent household.
\item
  In Somalia where security considerations prevented the usual
  sampling techniques to be carried out an innovative technique was
  used\footnote{Source: PARIS21 NSDS guidelines on data dissemination:
    \url{https://nsdsguidelines.paris21.org/node/796}}, (see \textsuperscript{Utz~Pape~and~Philip~Wollburg})\textsuperscript{.} To address
  security concerns, the Somalia High Frequency Survey adapted
  logistical arrangements, sampling strategy, and questionnaire design
  to limit time on the ground. In logistical arrangements, a detailed
  and timely security assessment ensured that the enumeration areas
  to‐be‐visited were safe on the day of fieldwork. The fieldwork
  protocol was designed such that teams would spend as little time as
  possible in any given region and draw little attention, ensuring
  enumerator and respondent safety. Concerning sampling strategy, it
  was not feasible to conduct a full listing of all households in an
  enumeration area, as this was too time‐intensive and may have raised
  suspicion. Instead, a micro‐listing approach was used, which
  required enumeration areas to be segmented into smaller enumeration
  blocks using satellite imagery. Enumeration blocks are small enough
  for enumerators to list and select households immediately before
  conducting the interview. (see also paragraph 350 and The High
  Frequency Survey in South Sudan\footnote{\url{http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/stats/publications/2018/ECECESSTAT20182.pdf}

Box 2.4: Turkey example: Two-Stage Sampling Methodology Combining
Spatial Survey and Respondent-Driven (Snowball) Sampling

\begin{quote}
Context: WFP was interested in a vulnerability assessment of the refugee population in Turkey.
Challenge: Difficult to identify population (in this case, unregistered refugees), that are likely not randomly distributed geographically and have no comprehensive sampling frame.
Methodology: The study used a two-stage sampling methodology.
The first stage was a Simple Spatial Survey Method (S3M) that sought to select settlements evenly (rather than randomly) across Turkey's geography. Using R's spatial-sampler function, the researchers superimposed a hexagonal grid over the country, and then selected the refugee settlement that was closest to the nodes of the grid. It also stratified by urban/rural sites, although this stratification was later abandoned due to difficulty of reaching rural respondents. This grid-based sampling method lacks the benefits of true randomness but is acceptable if there is a belief that there are significant differences in geography that might not be adequately captured by a random sample.
The second stage was Respondent-Driven Sampling, which combined a snowball sample and probability weighting based on network theory. First researchers selected 2-3 seed households close to each of the geographic points (seeds) selected by the S3M model. The seed households were selected based on having strong social networks and willingness to participate, but researchers also tried to select households of different ages, genders, aid eligibility, and socioeconomic status. While this likely resulted in a more diverse set of initial households, if this stratification was conducted by field researchers in an ad hoc manner it may have unwittingly biased the sample. The researchers then used a snowball sampling method -- after interviewing the first round of seed households, they asked each household to identify 2-3 additional refugee households who they could speak to. This process repeated at each subsequent step until the researchers had selected 25 respondent households from each seed. Based on the original 52 sampling sites, this generated a sample size of approximately 1,300 households.
Researchers then used the RDSAT application to analyse information about the respondent's social network in order to generate an individual weighting value for each respondent that adjusts for their likelihood of being selected. This weighting process uses network theory to adjust for the non-random nature of the households who are more likely to be selected by this sampling method, and to arrive at a post-weighting sample that should be more representative of the general population. Analysis can then be performed on the post-weighting sample.
Conclusion: While this methodology can be used in situations in which there is no available frame and populations are hidden, it has several sources of bias that make it inferior to true probability sampling. For instance, there is a tendency for respondents to refer households who are similar to them in non-representative ways (e.g.~select households from the same ethnic group). While the RDS application can help correct for some of this bias, it is important to ensure that the original seeds are representative of the population in a rigorous manner, and that this method not be used when more comprehensive sampling frames are available.

Box 2.5: Enumeration and Profiling of IDPs, refugees and migrants in
Hargeisa, Somaliland (December 2015)

\begin{quote}
Context: Somaliland had developed a policy framework on internal displacement in 2014, but still needed comprehensive and reliable data in order to inform its implementation by stakeholders.
Challenge: Study was starting from a very low-information baseline, and had difficulties getting access to a representative sample of the population due to resistance within the camp populations and the dispersed nature of the urban population.
Methodology:
Given the dearth of information available to researchers at the start of the study, the first stage of sampling was to develop a credible map of the population in the various settlements through information-gathering meetings with community focal points (imams, elders, teachers, community organizations). The next stage, enumeration, sought to reach all households in the camps with a brief 12-question census to establish membership to person of concern group (IDPs from Somaliland, Refugee returnees, Economic migrants, etc.). This census succeeded in reaching nearly 12-thousand households, and provided them each with a barcode that, along with phone numbers, was later used for randomization. Thus, the listing exercise resulted in multiple sampling frames of household as the final sampling units for the different populations of concern.
From the enumerated list of 11,962 households, 2,510 were selected to be surveyed. The randomization was stratified by person of concern category, so that the selected sample was proportionate to the population totals. Non-probabilistic sampling was applied to groups that did not have a population size large enough to support randomization (asylum seekers and IDPs from South Central Somalia).
As a result of the population size of some groups being small, as mentioned in the previous paragraph, the study also used non-probabilistic snowball sampling methods for the IDPs from South Central Somalia who lived in urban areas outside the camp, asking each respondent to refer additional households for the study. Due to the non-random nature of this selection mechanism, this cannot be considered a representative sample, although it may give a qualitative sense of overall IDP sentiments.
Limitations:
Due to community resistance to being categorized as IDPs, the enumeration stage was asked to conclude before it was able to reach all households living in the settlements. Thus there is a disconnect between the sample frame and the population of interest. There were also challenges with accessing refugees and asylum seekers directly -- many declined to be interviewed, and others had had their enumeration barcodes taken by their landlords. While both of these elements contribute to a higher risk of bias within the sample, they speak more to the logistical difficulties inherent in working with IDP and refugee populations rather than any avoidable methodological problem with the study design. All possible mitigation steps should be taken to avoid these types of issues, but only if they can be addressed without jeopardizing the safety of researchers, the well-being of respondents, and the goodwill of communities.
There were also some challenges identifying the categories that were most appropriate for households, particularly between economic migrants and IDPs. If possible, it is important to establish clear and consistent guidelines whenever a categorization methodology is to be used.

24. The type of population to be covered and their mobility within

    registered with the authorities, versus refugees who are likely
    to more stable and often registered with the authorities once an
    application for asylum has be made and processed.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{138}
\item
  The geographical scope and characteristics of the target population
  should be determined. This involves describing where the members of
  the target population are located, defining the boundaries of the
  area they are in (e.g.~administrative or natural boundaries), and,
  if relevant to the study, adding any other information that
  characterises the physical space of the target population such as
  natural hazards or political situation.
\item
  The target population should further be narrowed down by
  determining what differentiates them from the general resident
  population of the study area (unless of course the latter is the
  target population). This can for example be descriptions such as
  ``IDPs in urban settings in Colombia'' or ``refugees living in a camp''.
  Vulnerabilities, specific age groups, socio-economic
  characteristics, displacement status and legal immigration status
  are examples for such a description.
\item
  Especially in a volatile and fast-changing setting like forced
  displacement, a clear definition of the time frame or point in time
  covered by the study with respect to the target population is
  important in order to develop a well-defined sampling scheme.

\setcounter{enumi}{141}
\item
  \textbf{Ineligibles}: Ineligibles are elements of the general population
  who are not part of the target population of the study. These may be
  non-IDPs who are erroneously selected in a sample of IDPs.
\item
  \textbf{Inaccuracies}: Sampling frames obtained from previous surveys,
  censuses or administrative data might contain outdated information.
  For example, when using 5-year old census data of urban and rural
  areas to draw a representative sample of the population, we need to
  carefully assess whether population growth rates have been different
  for rural and urban areas during these 5 years, or whether there
  have been large population movements caused by displacements. If
  there have been more people have been moving from the countryside to
  cities than the other way around, but our sampling frame does not
  account for it, then using the old census data would lead to
  under-sampling of urban areas.
\item
  \textbf{Missing information}: In the context of forced displacement, it
  can be difficult to obtain information to define target population
  and construct sampling frames, especially for unregistered
  out-of-camp populations. In such situations, alternative information
  sources should be considered. These could include but are not
  limited to; previous studies, scoping exercises, qualitative
  assessments, key information interviews, desk review,
  community-based methods to build sampling frames.
\item
  \textbf{Multiple listing}: Multiple listing denotes the situation where
  a final sampling unit such as a household gets listed more than once
  in the sampling frame. This can be a problem for example in
  respondent-driven non-probability sampling frames where listed
  households are asked if they know of other households that fit the
  target population. One household can easily be mentioned more than
  once. Sampling frames need to be carefully assessed and cleaned to
  ensure no final sampling unit appears more than once.

  There are several potential sources of non-survey data on displaced
  people, the first is national population registers, the second is
  administrative data maintained by governments for the purpose of
  administering a range of services, controlling migration or issuing
  documentation, and the third is operational data kept by
  humanitarian agencies and governments for the purposes of supporting
  displaced people. This section gives examples of population
  registers, supplemented administrative records; and describes the
  operational data maintained by UNHCR about displaced populations and
  the way it is used.
\item
  Eurostat, in its Reference and Management of Nomenclatures system
  (RAMON) defines administrative data as a \textbf{"}Database which is
  updated continuously (often for administrative purposes, such as
  population registers or building registers) and from which
  statistics can be extracted / aggregated / computed".\footnote{Source:
    \url{https://paris21.org/sites/default/files/datapresentation_norway.pdf}
    - page 61.}
\item
  Administrative data are a useful source of information for
  measuring both the stock of displaced populations, and potentially
  the flows. If they include variables allowing the identification of
  the target population, or if the specific administrative source can
  be linked at the individual level to another data source such as
  another register, a survey or a census, then they provide potential
  for integrating a number of sources (See next section Data Source D:
  Integrated Data). This can potentially be a rich source of
  statistics.
\item
  Very diverse types of primary administrative data may be of
  interest from a statistical point of view, these include:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{verbatim}
28. Specific registers maintained by administrations or
    organisations responsible for refugees and IDPs (including
    registration of displaced people in camps and/or elsewhere).

29. Databases maintained by humanitarian organisations supporting
    refuges in informal settlements. These are often linked to the
    beneficiaries accessing displacement specific services and
    benefits.

30. General population registers of the total resident population of
    a country and/or registers of foreign citizens.

31. Other administrative registers (residence permit registers, tax
    registers, social security registers, register of border
    crossings etc.).
\end{verbatim}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{149}
\item
  Such administrative registers are, in particular, the main data
  source for statistics on asylum applicants and decisions taken
  during the asylum application process in regions such as Europe and
  Northern America. In the EU and in some additional neighbouring
  countries, they are also the main source of statistics on the number
  of refugees living in the country through specific sub-categories of
  reasons to stay in the residence permits statistics (refugees legal
  status, subsidiary protection, humanitarian reasons) and statistics
  on persons who are the subject of pending applications for
  international protection (asylum seekers whose application is still
  being examined).
\item
  In many countries without the current capacity to maintain
  administrative registers, UNHCR maintains registers on behalf of the
  government until the necessary capacity is developed. Arrangements
  can be made for accessing these registers for statistical purposes.
\item
  A number of countries keep population registers, and several
  examples of these are described in this manual. The United Nations'
  \emph{Recommendations on Statistics on International Migration Revision
  1} (1998) provides useful guidance for utilising administrative data
  sources for migration statistics in general, and refugee statistics
  in particular. These recommendations can be adapted for IDP
  registers, however IDPs are often not included, and if they are then
  they may not be identifiable as IDPs because their movements have
  not been captured.
\item
  According to these recommendations, two types of administrative
  sources should be considered for the collection of migration
  statistics:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{verbatim}
32. Administrative registers, defined as "a data system providing
    for the continuous recording of selected information pertaining
    to each member of the target population" and including
    "population registers, registers of foreigners and other special
    type of registers covering particular groups of persons, such as
    registers of asylum seekers" (United Nations, 1998, p. 17).

33. Other administrative sources derived "from the operation of
    administrative procedures designed to control international
    migration" including sources related to "the issuance of
    residence permits", "the issuance of work permits",
    "applications for asylum", "tax or social security", and "border
    collections" (United Nations, 1998, pp. 20, 23).
\end{verbatim}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{153}
\item
  To be useful for IDP statistics the system must be accessible to
  those who have been displaced and be regularly updated to reflect
  recent movements, changes of circumstances and to reflect flows in
  the stock by either adding new cases or removing those who have
  exited from the stock.
\item
  For refugees and refugee related populations asylum seekers are
  often not treated as part of the usually resident population and are
  therefore omitted from the population register. Registers of asylum
  seekers or foreigners may also be required to complete the
  statistical estimates, (see Part II of this Manual: Hungary see
  para. 589, and Turkey Case Studies see para. 630 and 654.
\item
  The use of ``registers of asylum seekers'' is specifically
  recommended for estimating the stock of asylum seekers (by length of
  stay in the country) and the number of new asylum applications
  within a given year (United Nations, 1998, p.~19), and for producing
  statistics on the outcome of the asylum procedure.
\item
  Two types of units are used to record applications, ``cases or
  applications'' and ``persons \[covered by these cases or
      applications\]'' and consequently to be registered.

  In Hungary both the National Directorate-General For Aliens

  publish official statistics on persons involved in forced migration.
  National Directorate-General for Aliens Policing (NDGAP) is the
  authority which is responsible for the asylum procedure in Hungary.
  The NDGAP produces statistics on the asylum procedure, on numbers of
  persons taken under international protection status (refugees under
  the Geneva Convention and persons taken under subsidiary protection)
  and the figures of the persons who receive national humanitarian
  status (persons who are taken under the principle of non-

  The NDGAP decides on the asylum applications\footnote{Source:

  refugees under the Geneva Convention and persons who are under
  subsidiary protection. Data is forwarded to the Ministry of Interior
  which runs the Population and Address Register (PAR). In Hungary the
  persons taken under international protection are issued with an
  identity card (and have similar rights to Hungarian citizens) and
  therefore their data is stored in the population register.
\item
  In contrast to asylum seekers who are not considered to be part of
  the usually resident population and are not included on the PAR,
  refugees and subsidiary protected persons are part of the usual

  Refugee statistics in Norway are produced from administrative data.
  All asylum seekers must register with the Norwegian immigration
  authorities, and their case data and personal data are stored in a
  database maintained by the Norwegian Directorate of Immigration
  (UDI). The database contains data on UN convention refugees as well
  as refugees who enter Norway on their own and apply for asylum.
\item
  The UDI statistics division has access to copies of raw data from
  the database and has the ability to extract, aggregate and process
  the data in whatever way it chooses. At the same time, selected
  personal and case data are transferred directly from the case
  processing system to the Central Population Register (CPR), and from
  there transferred to Statistics Norway through daily batch jobs. UDI
  also provides supplemental, processed data to Statistics Norway in a
  data set that is compiled every year. The most important variable in
  this data set is each immigrant's reason for immigration.
\item
  An obvious {advantage} of this system is that the
  producers of official statistics on refugees -- Statistics Norway
  and UDI -- have excellent access to data as well as control of how
  the data is processed, analysed and disseminated.
\item
  A major {challenge} is that data collection first and
  foremost is designed and built for case processing, not to produce
  statistics. Hence, the main purpose of the data collection is to
  facilitate the flow of applications through the administrative
  systems, while keeping track of the applicants' legal status and
  rights. Many people are involved in the handling of each
  application, and the system is built to enable each case handler to
  finish tasks and transfer the case to the next person, through all
  the steps from application to final decision. For this purpose, it
  may not even be necessary to access or collect structured data, as
  many case processing tasks can be resolved simply based on case
  documents.

  All addresses within the boundaries of the country were registered
  in the National Address Database (NAD) in 2006, and by linking
  addresses of Turkish citizens living within the boundaries of the
  country with the Turkish identification number, Address Based
  Population Registration System (ABPRS) was established in 2007.
  Subsequently, in order to obtain information which was not available
  in the ABPRS at provincial level, Population and Housing Survey
  (PHS) was conducted using a combined methodology (by linking the
  ABPRS to a large-scale sample survey) in 2011. According to the
  Official Statistics Programme, annual information on population size
  by administrative division (province, district, town, village and
  quarter), and its basic characteristics (age-sex structure, place of
  registration, nationality, literacy and educational attainment,
  legal marital status, place of birth, type of households, and
  internal migration in province level) are produced from ABPRS and
  announced to the public in January of the following year.
\item
  TurkStat is responsible for producing stock and flow statistics on
  international migration by demographic and other related indicators
  of migrants. For foreigners residing in Turkey, citizenship and
  country of birth statistics are produced from ABPRS. In addition,
  TurkStat produced information on immigration and emigration, namely
  annual migration flow statistics, for the first time based on
  administrative registers in 2018 for the years 2016 and 2017.
  Similar to the statistics on foreign stock population, migration
  flow statistics covering both Turkish citizens and foreigners are
  produced in ``country of birth'' and ``country of citizenship''
  breakdowns (no disaggregation by refugee or refugee like
  populations). In order to obtain the statistics on foreign
  population residing in Turkey, foreign registers held by the General
  Directorate of Civil Registration and Nationality (GDCRN) and the
  residence-work permit registers are mainly used.
\item
  Along with the Göç-Net (migration management system), registers of
  residence permits, international protection (applications, refugee,
  conditional refugee, subsidiary protection, and temporary protection
  under international protection), illegal migration and other events
  related to foreigners are kept in connection to each other.
  Directorate General of Migration Management (DGMM) is responsible
  for collection, analysis and dissemination of the data on
  international protection, residence permits and irregular migration.
\item
  Principal variables defined concerning applicants of international
  protection are age, gender, educational status, nationality and
  marital status etc. Statistical figures on international protection
  applications are shared on DGMM's official website and published in
  Annual Migration Reports of DGMM on a yearly basis.
\item
  With the \emph{``Temporary Protection Regulation''} issued in 2014,
  Syrians seeking international protection were given temporary
  protection status in Turkey. Syrians are granted a foreign
  identification number to benefit from health, education, labour
  market access and social support services. Based on the legal
  (de-jure) population definition, Syrians under temporary protection
  are not covered in the Address Based Population Registration System
  (ABPRS). Thus, this population group is not officially accepted as
  ``resident population''. Only the Syrians who entered the country
  legally (with the required official documents such as a passport)
  are included in ABPRS population like other foreigners holding a
  residence permit/work permit. Briefly, while approximately 3.5
  million Syrians under temporary protection are not covered in ABPRS,
  the number of Syrians in the ABPRS was just 87,955 as of December
  31, 2018.
\item
  The number of persons under temporary protection in Turkey was
  14,000 in 2012 reached 225,000 thousand in 2013, 1.5 million in
  2014, 2.5 million in 2015, 3.5 million in 2017 and almost 3.6
  million as of June 2018.

  Statistics on IDPs and refugees are produced by a member of the
  National Statistical System, the Ministry of Human Rights and
  Refugees. This is a state level organisation responsible for
  unifying the data from other entities and districts, and for
  producing statistical reports. The country's municipalities and
  cantons are responsible for collecting the data and for delivering
  it to the Ministry, together with The Ministry of Refugees and DPs
  of the Republika Srpska Entity; and the Government of Brčko District
  B\&H, Department of Displaced Persons, Refugees, and Housing.
\item
  Producing statistics on refugees and IDPs was initiated by the
  government at the beginning of the war in the 1990s. When war ended
  the first comprehensive official registration of persons in B\&H was
  carried out in late 2000 by Ministries and local authorities. The
  registration and estimation of the number and the status of
  displaced persons was completed on 31/03/2005.
\item
  The administrative records in the Database of Displaced Persons
  (DDPR) are the main source of statistics on refugees and IDPs,
  supplemented by census data. Details of the variables found in the
  DDPR can be found in the Part II Case Study, as can the census form
  which included specific questions on persons displaced since 1991.
  These questions include their habitual place of residence place of
  residence and returns and legal status.

  The National Planning Department and the National Department for
  Social Prosperity collect and produce official statistics on the
  country`s most vulnerable population.~These datasets~account for
  most of the administrative records used by the Victims` Unit to
  update socio economic variables of IDPs at an individual level.
  Other relevant datasets are the official education enrolment system,
  the social security system, the registers´ office, the housing and
  agricultural subsidies registers, among others.~
\item
  The official source to count the stock of IDPs in Colombia is the
  Single Victims` Registry managed by the Victims` Unit, a
  government agency responsible for providing assistance and
  reparation to victims of the armed conflict. The Single Victims´
  Registry has been counting IDPs since 1985. At October 2019, 7.5
  million IDPs were registered.~ IDP households who wish to be
  included in the Single Victims´ Registry present a declaration
  before the Public Ministry (Ombudsman´s Regional Office,
  Procurator´s Municipal Office).~~According to the national
  legislation an IDP has to declare within two years after the event
  of displacement took place. Once an IDP is granted the status of
  victim, they are included in the Single Victims´ Registry. Once
  registered they are entitled to access relevant assistance and
  reparation.~
\item
  An individual assessment of vulnerability is run twice a year for
  IDPs registered in the Single Victims´ Registry.~The data used to
  run the assessment comes from both primary and secondary sources.~
  Primary data is collected through a survey conducted by phone on a
  continuous basis. Secondary data, which is the main source of data,
  involves the exchange of official administrative records with other
  government agencies at both national and local level.~Additionally,
  IDPs update their location directly to the Victims´ Unit through
  services points located throughout the country. ~
\item
  There is a Protocol for Information Exchange between the Victims`
  Unit and all the government agencies which form part of the National
  System for the~Assistance~and Reparation of Victims. The process of
  information exchange is formalised through a Memorandum of
  Understanding, in compliance with the relevant legislation.~
\item
  Various statistics can be calculated out of the Single Victims´
  Registry: these are disaggregation by sex, age, ethnicity, type of
  human right violation (displacement, forced~disappearance, homicide,
  threat, among others), geographic location or~number of victims per
  year.
\item
  For statistical purposes, an IDP is taken out of the stock when
  they overcome displacement related vulnerabilities.

  Most of them by humanitarian organisations providing assistance to
  IDPs. The studies do not generate official statistics. The
  International Organization for Migration regularly produce
  statistics on IDPs in Ukraine through their National Monitoring
  System, based on their Displacement Tracking Matrix approach. It

  Registration data for `Operational Planning and Programming' is
  required for designing, planning and delivering suitable programmes
  for the population of concern. Registration data analysis
  strengthens the overall operational intelligence for protection and
  solutions, helping to facilitate early identification of protection
  risks and highlights protection gaps as well as target resources for
  the greatest protection impact.
\item
  \textbf{Registration data can only be usefully analysed if the data
  collected at registration is complete, of a good quality and
  regularly updated}. A good registration system should also include
  mechanisms to manage its data, making it reliable and effective for
  planning and programming. There are many reasons why registration
  data may be of poor quality: data entry error, inadequate training
  for staff, ill-designed processes and insufficient oversight,
  cultural misunderstanding or weak standard operating procedures.
\item
  The personal data of persons of concern must be managed in a

  data protection principles set out in UNHCR's \textbf{\href{http://www.refworld.org/pdfid/55643c1d4.pdf}{Data Protection
  policy}{.}}
  To this end, data repositories (databases) should be designed so
  that access rights for each content material are determined
  individually per user, based on a ``need-to-know'' and ``need-to-use''
  basis. A framework on the segregation of duties aims to clearly
  define and grant the level of access that corresponds with the

  Because of the variety and the varying coverage of the possible
  sources containing statistical information on refugee and internally
  displaced persons (IDPs), data integration is a promising solution
  for improving the quality of refugee and IDPs statistics. Recent
  projects like the UNECE High Level Group for the Modernisation of
  Official Statistics (HLG-MOS) or the Eurostat ESS 2020 vision
  project in the area of data integration witness of the growing
  interest for data integration.
\item
  In particular, data integration can answer several challenges
  raised when compiling official statistics on refugee and IDPs by:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{verbatim}
34. Improving the coverage of target groups,

35. Improving data availability, especially socio-economic variables
    related to refugee and IDP populations,

36. Improving accuracy through the crossing of different sources in
    order to assess refugee and IDP status.

  The objective of this part of the Manual is to present the main
  steps related to data integration as well as an overview on the
  possible data integration techniques which can help and guide
  practitioners in NSOs interested in applying data integration to
  refugee and IDPs statistics. As far as possible, the provided
  information will be illustrated by existing good practices in NSOs
  and will be completed by more detailed technical information and
  references about the presented methods.
\item
  This section is an edited version of the full text on data
  integration. A much fuller description of options and techniques can
  be found in Part 3 of this report PART III -- 2D Data Integration
  Techniques.
\item
  The first step is to clearly define the output objectives of
  integration and to agree this with the providers of the data sources
  to be used. This is followed by a discussion of the several issues
  that NSOs will face if they want to apply data integration
  techniques; these issues relate to the legal environment and data
  protection legislation, the relationships with external data
  providers, the required IT resources and the skills needed. The next
  section addresses issues pertaining to the main sources which could
  be the object of data integration and is followed by the main data
  integration statistical methods. These methods are illustrated by
  examples of good practices. Since any data integration process
  actually covers all the phases of the GSBPM, practitioners and data
  compilers can refer to the other parts of the Compilers' Manual for
  more detailed information on the statistical tasks common to all
  statistical processes, such as the quality assessment or the design
  of the process.

  The design of the integration methodology constitutes one of the
  main tasks to be realised in data integration. Besides the technical
  tasks, good collaboration with external data providers and other
  involved stakeholders is of high importance when designing the data
  collection, production system and workflows. Very often, the sources
  that are considered for data integration are not under the direct
  responsibility of statistical authorities. The first requirement is
  to ensure the data's availability and accessibility, as well as to
  have in place the capacities to use them (see also Phase 1.5. Check
  Data Availability).
\item
  This process is obviously strongly dependent on the national
  context, in particular the legal environment as well as the status

  Some countries provide a legal basis for the NSO to access data and
  metadata for all available administrative data sources for
  evaluating their potential use in official statistics. If, based on
  the metadata, the data source is judged to be useful to build new or
  improve existing official statistics, then test data can be
  requested to further assess data quality and to produce prototype
  statistics.
\item
  A guarantee of data confidentiality, ethical standards, as well as
  the legal environment obliges NSOs to guarantee the confidentiality
  of data, either for dissemination or when sharing data with other
  providers. In particular, NSOs shall avoid direct identification or
  indirect identification of the respondent (statistical unit). Direct
  identification means identification of the respondent from their
  formal identifiers (name, address, identification number), whereas
  indirect identification means inferring a respondent's identity by
  a combination of variables or characteristics (e.g.~age, gender,
  education etc). Concerning dissemination, statistical disclosure
  control can use methods like tabular data protection for aggregate
  information on respondents presented in tables (use of suppression,
  rounding, randomisation and/or interval publication) and micro-data
  protection (using local suppression, sampling, global recoding, top
  and bottom coding, rounding, rank swapping and micro-aggregation).
  Concerning the storage of data, physical protection guarantee that
  the data is securely stored and not accessible to anyone without
  explicit authorisation. When coming to data integration (micro-data
  sharing with external data providers), the use of anonymisation
  techniques (see also \emph{g. Security environment} discussed below)
  shall guarantee the confidentiality of the data shared.

\begin{verbatim}
72. Administrative registers on refugees and IDPs: asylum seekers
    registers (applications), registers on decisions granting
    international protection, resettled persons register, residence
    permits registers, population registers, IDP registers.

73. Other administrative registers: social and health registers, tax
    registers, social security registers, electricity subscribers,
    etc.

74. Census.

75. General population surveys: general sample survey (labour force,
    education, income, living conditions, ...).

76. Dedicated surveys on refugees and IDPs.

77. Operational data collected by UNHCR or NGOs, e.g. movement
    tracking systems (Displacement Tracking Matrix).

78. Geographical Information system (GIS).

79. New digital sources: Passively collected information from
    satellite images, mobile phones, web-scraping and web-crawling
    of internet platforms or social media content?

  As the list of possible sources presented in \emph{Table 2.19: Main
  characteristics of potential data sources for integration} shows, a
  unique source does not exist that is capable of drawing a complete
  statistical picture of refugees and IDPs. Either in term of coverage
  or data availability, usually only integration of several sources
  can lead to the production of the necessary statistics for the
  users. Most often, integration of several sources, requires the
  linking of several data sources at the micro-level by using an
  identifier common to all the involved sources. Sometimes, data
  integration can also consist in using several sources at a more
  aggregated level in order to derive the best estimate of a target
  value, in particular the total number of a population. In both
  cases, micro and macro data integration, output objectives of the
  foreseen process must be well defined.

  One of the main challenges in any data integration project is how
  to establish the link between the different data sets, and the fact
  that those data sources usually have different structures. Depending
  on how the data need to be integrated, this can be generalized into
  2 main categories;
\end{enumerate}

\begin{verbatim}
80. **Data linking (Join):** normally a common variable is required
    in multiple data sets to establish a link. This common variable
    or variables is called a Join Key. It could be one unique
    identifier used in 2 data sets such as a national ID number, or
    it could be set of quasi identifiers that exists in both data
    sets. The figure below illustrates an example of what needs to
    be done to expand the data set horizontally or by adding more
    variables to analysed data set.

\setcounter{enumi}{80}

\item
  \textbf{Data consolidation (Union, or data alignment):} when data sets
  come from multiple sources and the aim is to create one unified
  dataset with all records. As data sets might have different
  structure and variable scopes, there might be a need to transform
  the variables before adding them to the consolidated dataset. For
  example, in one data set there might be date of birth while the
  target dataset uses the year of birth. In that case one needs to
  transform date of birth before loading the data into the target
  dataset. As under the previous example, one can think of what needs
  to be done to expand the data set vertically or by adding more
  observations to analysed dataset.

  This section describes the different tasks required by data
  integration and provides a description and references on the methods
  that could be applied. This part is mainly based on the work done
  within the framework of the ESS Vision 2020 ADMIN (Administrative
  data sources), in particular the one on data integration and
  estimation methods\footnote{Source:
    \url{https://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/stats/publications/Managing.statistical.confidentiality.and.microdata.access.pdf}
    - page 6.}. Nevertheless, this section shows as far as
  possible how integration and estimation methods could be applied to
  the field of refugee and IDP statistics.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{219}
\item
  When using multisource data, inconsistencies at micro level are
  frequently encountered. Integration of data sources at micro-level
  may give rise to composite records that consist of a combination of
  values obtained from several different sources. For instance, a
  register could be combined with values obtained from a survey for
  the same units (obtained by record linkage); or from an integration
  of several surveys with non-overlapping units, in which case a unit
  from one source is matched with a similar (but not identical) unit
  from another source. Records with values obtained from different
  sources can also arise as a consequence of item non-response and
  subsequent imputation, in which case the two sources are the
  directly observed values versus the values generated by the
  imputation method. In all these cases the composition of a record by
  combining information obtained from different sources may lead to
  consistency problems because the information is conflicting, in the
  sense that edit rules that involve variables obtained from the
  different sources are violated. The purpose of editing conflicting
  micro-data is to achieve numerical consistency in the first instance
  and, ultimately, statistical consistency of the resulting
  aggregates.
\item
  For example, a survey provides an aggregated value A for the total
  income received from social allowances received by person x; this
  value A should be equal to the sum of two types of allowances B
  (health) and C (education) collected through administrative sources.
  If A is not equal to the sum of B and C, this inconsistency should
  be removed by using micro integration methods\footnote{Source:
    \url{https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/42577/43978/Social-Media-Guidelines-09-2011}
    - page 2.} like prorating,
  minimum adjustment methods, or generalised Ratio Adjustments. In the
  case of data on refugee and internally displaced persons, such
  aggregation rules when integrating several sources should be rather
  rare, but their existence should be checked on a case by case basis,
  and data compilers should take them into account if necessary. Micro
  integration or editing conflicting micro-data needs to be
  distinguished from variable harmonisation (later on described) which
  applies to situations where there exist similar versions of the same
  target variable, for instance due to different definitions across
  the sources.

\item
  A full description of a) \emph{data linkage: combining data from several
  sources belonging to the same group, and b) data matching: inference
  of joint distribution from marginal observations, can be found in
  greater detail in Part III of this Manual} \emph{Creation of joint
  statistical micro data. }
\item
  The integration of data at micro level with the main purpose of
  accurately reflecting the individual's real-world circumstances at
  individual micro level, even when the data are stored in different
  sources of various types, is known as record linkage. Ultimately,
  the record linkage process creates a micro dataset where the
  corresponding separate observations are combined into joint
  statistical data drawn from information which originate in multiple
  sources. Record linkage is also referred to as object
  identification, record matching, entity matching, entity resolution,
  or reference reconciliation. In the case of the National Statistical
  Institutes (NSIs) the joint use of statistical and administrative
  sources is a product of a rationalization of all the available
  sources in order to reduce costs, response burden and, most of all,
  to enrich the information collected in order to produce high quality
  statistics.
\item
  An important distinction between record linkage and statistical
  matching needs to be made, the former regards the ``fusion'' of
  sources composed mainly of the same units, partially or completely
  overlapping, e.g., in the case of integration of administrative
  registers and sample surveys, while the latter concerns the
  integration of different units, e.g.~derived from different sample
  surveys.
\item
  The record linkage problem requires statistical estimation methods
  when unique identifiers are not available for all the units in the
  sources, or the unique keys are affected by errors, or a unique
  composite key can be derived from a combination of error-prone
  variables. The presence of errors in the unit identifiers and the
  use of statistical estimation methods for linking data files, may
  introduce linkage errors in the integrated data. This point needs to
  be taken into consideration by data compilers' during the design of
  the data linkage process. Actually, a standard statistical
  estimation approach can produce inaccurate results in case of
  linkage errors, which requires the use of statistical methods in
  order to evaluate and adjust for linkage errors.
\item
  In \textbf{statistical matching}, also referred to as data fusion, the
  ultimate aim is to provide estimates on variables observed in
  distinct data sources by exploiting the available common information
  (variables observed in both data sources). The data to be joined is
  characterized by representing the same population but not
  necessarily having common units. Thus, statistical matching can be
  framed as an imputation problem in which a missing target variable
  for units in a recipient data set is predicted based on information
  on similar units (``statistical twins'') observed in a donor data set.
\item
  A statistical matching problem can be defined according to its
  objective and data availability:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{verbatim}
82. (objective) knowledge on a (possibly conditional) joint
    distribution function of a couple of random variables, or on
    some of the parameters representing the (conditional) joint
    relationship between the two random variables, or on a data set
    representative of the (conditional) joint distribution of the
    two variables, is requested;

83. (available data) the two random variables of interest are not
    available jointly in any datasets, but it is possible to use two
    random samples, each one observing one of the two random
    variables, both observing all the conditioning variables.
    Furthermore, the two samples should be representative of the
    same population, but the overlap between the two observed sets
    of units is either null or consists of subsets of units that are
    not representative of the population itself.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{227}
\item
  The two most important outputs that statistical matching can
  produce are: either macro (estimation of a joint distribution or of
  a relationship parameter) or micro (a data set with complete
  observations on the variables of interest, i.e.~both the couple of
  random variables and the conditioning variables). It is worthwhile
  noting that the macro approach to statistical matching may be also
  be considered as a `Multisource estimation at aggregated level'. In
  the field of refugee and IDP statistics, the micro-objective (fusion
  of two datasets) is the most frequent possible use of data matching.
\item
  A full description of deterministic and probabilistic linking, with
  examples, can be found in Part III) Creation of joint statistical
  micro data.

\hypertarget{d.3.-alignment-of-populations-and-measurements}{%
\subsubsection{Alignment of populations and measurements}\label{d.3.-alignment-of-populations-and-measurements}}

\emph{a. Alignment of populations: Unit harmonisation}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{229}
\item
  When data originating from multiple sources are used, one needs to
  transform objects into statistical units referring to the target
  population. This is a mandatory requirement valid both for usages
  based on a single data source, and for cases based on multisource
  data. After a preliminary analysis aimed at verifying such a
  consistency, it is sometimes necessary to start a process of
  harmonisation or alignment of statistical units. For example, when
  combining survey data with administrative registers, to create a
  living household as the ideal unit for refugee or IDP statistics,
  one needs to make use of units such as person, family, residence
  address, study or workplace address, etc. The different units need
  first to be aligned with each other, in order to improve the
  accuracy of the living household created based on them.
\item
  Possible estimation methods: No general statistical methods are
  available, while ad-hoc deterministic methods are generally used.
  For instance, statistical units are derived using certain
  deterministic derivation rules based on available information.
\end{enumerate}

\emph{b. Alignment of measurements: Variable harmonisation}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{231}
\item
  When administrative data are used, one needs to transform
  attributes of the objects into measurements referring to the
  concepts to be measured, that is the target variables. After a
  preliminary analysis aimed at verifying such a consistency, it is
  sometimes necessary to start a process of harmonisation or alignment
  of measurements.
\item
  When data from multiple sources are combined, differences in
  definition can occur between variables in different sources. In
  particular, variables in an administrative data source are defined
  according to the administrative purposes of the register owner.
  These definitions may differ from those of the target variables for
  statistical purposes. For example, when the variable `age-group' is
  observed in two data sources with different groups. A technique for
  obtaining a unique variable `age' is needed. This apparently
  deterministic task can involve statistical estimation method (e.g.,
  classification techniques) whenever a well-defined mapping is not
  known.
\item
  In case differences in variable definitions occur between data
  sources, these variables need to be harmonised during data
  integration. That is to say, for each unit in the integrated data
  set, the values of the target variable according to the desired
  definition need to be estimated from the observed values that are
  available.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{234}
\item
  This task refers to the phase of production of estimates by using
  integrated multisource administrative data. Estimation methods in
  this case must deal with the problem that data are not obtained
  according to a random sampling design, and that observations may
  refer to specific subsets of units of the population
  (under-coverage), or out-of-scope units (over-coverage). In
  addition, when integrated multisource data are used, specific
  problems may arise. They are concerned with the problem of
  consistency and coherence of estimates.
\item
  Part III of this Manual (paragraphs 836-869) describes a number of
  estimation and reconciliation techniques in much further detail
  including:
\end{enumerate}

\emph{a. Population size estimation: multiple lists with imperfect coverage
of target population.}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{236}
\item
  When each one of the multiple sources has imperfect coverage of the
  target population, including both under- and over-coverage,
  statistical methods for population size estimation are needed. The
  most common approaches relate to capture-recapture (CRC) methods. In
  estimating a population size based on several sources, the
  misalignment between the scope of the administrative data and that
  of the statistician poses several methodological challenges and sets
  us apart from a classical capture-recapture setting. For instance,
  it is often useful to develop methods taking into account the
  dependence among data sources, the fact that some data sources refer
  to a specific subpopulation, and that data may contain units
  out-of-the target population that are not deterministically
  identifiable.
\item
  In the case of refugees or IDPs statistics, the first assumption
  can be considered as true if the time between the capture and
  recapture is limited. Otherwise, deaths, births, and moves of the
  population of interest will break the hypothesis of a closed
  population. The validity of the second assumption depends on the
  quality of the available identifier for linking the sources.
  Difficult to reach refugees or IDPs through surveys will most likely
  not be recorded in administrative registers, which can break the
  third assumption and imply a problem of under-coverage. The fourth
  assumption corresponds to the fact that for example children, women
  and men have the same probability of inclusion. In case this is not
  verified, applying the CRC method to each identified specific group
  before proceeding to an aggregation of the results found for each
  group. Lastly, the fifth hypothesis could be assumed to be verified
  in most of the cases.
\item
  The violation of these assumptions can lead to serious bias in the
  CRC-estimation of the population size. CRC is in particular
  sensitive to violation of the assumption in the case of a low
  implied coverage, i.e.~the second register overlaps greatly with the
  first register and adds relatively few new records to it. So,
  several extensions of the CRC method were proposed in order to face
  problems connected to violation of the basic assumptions, we can
  divide them into two group: methods aiming at improving the
  CRC-method; alternatives methods.
\end{enumerate}

\emph{b. Reconciliation}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{239}
\item
  Different estimates for the same phenomenon could lead to confusion
  among users of these figures. Many NSIs have therefore adopted a
  one-figure policy. According to this one-figure policy, estimates
  for the same phenomenon in different tables should be reconciled,
  meaning that they should be equal to each other, even if these
  estimates are based on different underlying data sources.
\item
  When using a mix of administrative data sources and surveys on
  which to base estimates upon, obtaining one estimate for the same
  phenomenon may become problematic as for different (combinations of)
  variables data on different units, e.g.~different persons, may be
  available.
\item
  This means that different estimates concerning the same variable
  may yield different results, if one does not take special
  precautions. For instance, if one uses a standard weighting approach
  to produce estimates, where one multiplies observed counts or values
  with surveys weights, one may get different estimates based on two
  samples, because different units and hence different survey weights
  are used in the two samples.
\item
  In principle, these differences are merely caused by ``noise'' in the
  data, such as sampling errors. So, in a strictly statistical sense,
  different estimates concerning the same variables are to be expected
  and are not a problem. However, different estimates would violate
  the one-figure policy and form a problem for the users.

  "identifying user needs and cooperation with stakeholders"). In
  particular, the ESS Vision 2020 ADMIN (Administrative data sources)

  Member States to make wider and better use of administrative sources

  the European statistics produced using administrative data are
  comparable across Member States and are of sufficient quality. The

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{244}
\item
  The Central Population Register (CPR) of Norway was established in
  1964 based on the 1960 Population Census. A unique 11-digit personal
  identification number (PIN) was introduced at the same time. The CPR
  includes all persons who has ever been a (legal) resident of Norway
  since 1960, regardless of their citizenship. Persons who die or
  emigrate are not deleted from the register, but a code for their
  status is changed.
\item
  The most important stock (or status) variables in the CPR are:
  11-digit PIN (which includes date of birth and sex), residence
  status (resident, deceased, emigrated, no permanent address,
  disappeared), address, municipality, dwelling number, place of birth
  (municipality or country), name (incl.~first and middle names),
  citizenship, country of immigration, country of emigration, marital
  status, PIN of spouse, mother and father.
\item
  Persons who have come to Norway as refugees or asylum seekers are
  included in the CPR once they are recognized as legal residents.
  Refugees who arrive via UNHCR are given a PIN on arrival. Asylum
  seekers are assigned another ID number, called the D-number, when
  they apply for asylum. The D-number is used for administrative
  purposes for people who are not residents of Norway but who have
  economic or other links to Norway. It is only when a person is
  granted asylum that he or she is assigned a PIN number. Persons with
  D-numbers are not included in the official population statistics for
  Norway
\item
  All vital events and migrations and address changes are registered
  in the CPR. The most important flow variables are births, deaths,
  marital changes (incl.~same-sex marriages, separations, divorces and
  annulments), emigrations and immigrations, internal moves in Norway,
  address changes, name changes, citizenship changes, gender changes
  and PIN changes. When a report of a change is received by the CPR
  the information is checked, for example, that the spouses of a new
  marriage are not already married and that the parents of a new-born
  baby are residents.
\item
  The inclusion of the PINs of parents and spouses in the CPR makes
  it possible to establish links between siblings, cousins, children,
  grandparents and other relatives. The PIN is used in a large number
  of other administrative registers, which makes it possible to link
  information in different registers for statistics and research. The
  CPR is also used to draw samples for sample surveys. The contents,
  coverage and quality of the administrative registers have become so
  good that it is not any longer necessary to conduct traditional
  population and housing censuses. The last regular census was
  conducted in 2001, whereas the 2011 census was completely based on
  register data.
\item
  The two figures below show the flows of data on individuals
  (microdata) to and from the CPR. The entity at the middle of both
  figures, ``Population register'', functions both as the central
  register of civil events in Norway and as the country's population
  register. Thus, civil registration and national identity management
  are fully integrated. Births to residents of Norway and new
  immigrants are assigned personal identification numbers. Residents
  who die or emigrate are not physically removed from the register,
  but their codes are changed from ``Resident'' to ``Dead'' or
  ``Emigrated''.
\item
  The first figure shows that the population register receives
  microdata \emph{from} many public (and some private) institutions on
  births, deaths, many external migrations, marriages and divorces,
  adoptions, address changes, name changes, and other events. It also
  receives information directly from the individuals themselves on
  internal migration, many external migrations, and name changes.
\item
  It should be noted that the population register does not receive
  any microdata \emph{from} Statistics Norway, with a few exceptions, in
  keeping with the fundamental principles of statistics, that
  individual data collected by statistical agencies for statistical
  compilation are to be strictly confidential and used exclusively for
  statistical purposes. The second figure shows the public and private
  institutions \emph{to} which the Norwegian Tax Administration distributes
  microdata. Statistics Norway is one of the most important recipients
  and users of these data, together with health and educational
  institutions, the police, the army, the electoral register, banks,
  and other bodies.
\item
  The task of sharing the microdata is not performed by Statistics
  Norway, but by the owner of the administrative register, the
  Norwegian Tax Administration. Statistics Norway may, however, share
  anonymized data on individuals if this is approved by the data
  inspector.

  Statistics Norway receives updates on vital events and other
  changes in the register every night, five days a week, following the
  same routine as many other users of the population register that
  need daily updates for administrative purposes. The updates are
  verified every morning. The diagram below shows the relationship
  between the administrative and statistical population registers.
  Statistics Norway maintains two versions of the population register:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  A true copy of the administrative register;
\item
  A separate statistical population register, in which internal
  adjustments and amendments are made and saved.
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{254}
\item
  The key reason for this approach is that the administrative
  register is incomplete and may include errors and other
  shortcomings, such as missing data. Statistics Norway has access to
  many other administrative and statistical data sources and can link
  them to the copy of the central population register to check for
  possible errors or add information, such as country of birth if not
  registered by the CPR. This information cannot be shared with the
  Tax Administration without permission from the other sources for
  confidentiality reasons, but it still has an impact on the quality
  of the statistics produced. Statistics Norway may, however, report
  faulty microdata (including the PIN) back to the register owner,
  including the Tax Administration, as this may be considered a
  complaint regarding the quality of the data received. These error
  correction procedures must be in line with the principle that data
  relating to individuals should not be returned from a statistical
  agency to a supplier. The quality improvements mean that, in most
  cases, the statistical population register is a better source for
  statistics production than the administrative population register
  (CPR) would have been.
\item
  It is not possible to identify refugees/(former) asylum seekers
  directly in the CPR as information about reason for
  migration/residence permit is not one of the variables that is
  included in the original transactions from the CPR. However, this
  information is collected on a yearly basis where Statistics Norway
  receives data from the Directorate of Migration (this procedure is
  described more in detail in box 4.6 in the IRRS) and link these data
  using the PIN to match the statistical version with the CPR. Based
  on this information, Statistics Norway produces both flow and stock
  data on persons with a refugee background, see:
  \url{https://www.ssb.no/en/befolkning/statistikker/flyktninger/aar}{.}

  In Norway, population, migration and refugee statistics -- both on

\item
  The same definitions are used in both the CPR and in the SSB copy
  of the register and routines for updating correspond closely. The
  result is a good correspondence between the two registers, even
  after many years with physically independent updating routines.
  However, in addition to the variables received from the CPR, SSB
  constructs several variables that are needed for statistical
  purposes.
\item
  One of these is the variable `migration category' which is used for
  determining the population with immigrant background. See Figure
  2.3.

\item
  Following the unprecedented increase in asylum applications in 2015
  and 2016, the integration of refugees in housing markets, labour
  markets and in civic society is still a major priority for policy
  makers in Germany. Accordingly, policy makers demand for data on the
  situation of refugees, in order to monitor the progress of
  integration and to derive implications for integration policies. The
  idea of integrating data sources to satisfy this demand is
  intuitively appealing. Data integration is cost effective and
  imposes no additional response burden since information is produced
  by making better use of already existing data.
\item
  In general, countries differ with respect to their data environment
  and hence face different possibilities for integrating data sources.
  Differences largely depend on whether or not unique person
  identifiers exist in administrative data bases and whether or not
  the legal framework allows their use in official statistics. While
  matching datasets via unique identifiers represents the gold
  standard, the vast majority of countries will not be able to link
  information on refugees via unique identifiers within the
  foreseeable future. In this data environment statistical matching
  offers an alternative tool for integrating datasets. Statistical
  matching is usually described as the joint analysis of variables
  that are not jointly observed but available in different datasets.
  In contrast to record linkage that links information on identical
  units, statistical matching can hence be framed as an imputation
  problem in which a target variable in a recipient data set is
  predicted based on information on similar units -- ``statistical
  twins'' -- in a donor data set.
\item
  The data environment in which statistics on refugees and people in
  refugee-like situations are produced in Germany is typical for many
  countries: Germany uses administrative data on residence permits
  from the Central Register of Foreigners (CRF) to identify refugees
  and foreigners in refugee like situations. While the CRF confidently
  identifies and comprehensively covers refugees, it does not provide
  information on their socioeconomic characteristics or housing and
  living conditions. In addition, German official statistics uses the
  Labour Force Survey (LFS) for shedding light on the socioeconomic
  characteristics and the structural integration of first- and
  second-generation immigrants in Germany. While the LFS provides a
  detailed socioeconomic picture on these immigrants, it does neither
  confidently identify nor comprehensively cover refugees and
  foreigners in refugee-like situations.
\item
  Considering the production of statistics on refugees and people in
  refugee-like situations, the problem can be formally stated as
  follows: the information from the administrative data set (donor)
  are used in order to impute refugee status in the survey data set
  (recipient). For imputation a set of common variables (C) is used.
  The final aim is analysing the unobserved joint distributions of
  refugee status (R) and socioeconomic characteristics (S).

  This case-study aims at integrating the CRF and LFS via statistical
  matching to combine reliable information on residence status with a
  broad set of socioeconomic characteristics, e.g.~educational
  background and labour market participation. The common information
  on citizenship, date of entry, age and gender are used to impute
  refugee status for respondents of the LFS. For this task, a boosted
  and post-pruned Classification and Regression Tree (CART - C5.0) in
  the CRF is developed and used to identify refugees among LFS
  respondents. Statistical inference after statistical matching is
  implicitly based on the restrictive but untestable assumptions of
  conditional independence. Therefore, the case-study emphasizes the
  importance of carefully evaluating model performance and guides the
  reader through a framework of possible evaluation techniques.
\item
  In summary, this case-study adds to the existing literature in two
  ways: First, statistical matching techniques have not yet been
  applied to the field of refugee statistics -- a field in which they
  might be especially beneficial since they offer a quick and cheap
  alternative compared to traditional forms of data collection for
  refugee hosting countries. Secondly, the field of data science has
  developed rapidly over the last decade. Powerful classification
  algorithms have emerged that have not yet been exhaustively tested
  in the statistical matching environment. As a convenient feature,
  those algorithms are implemented in open source software\footnote{Insert link} making
  this study reproducible for a broad audience.

\subsection{Design production systems and workflow}\label{design-production-systems-and-workflow}}

``This sub-process determines the workflow from data collection to
dissemination, taking an overview of all the processes required within
the whole statistical production process, and ensuring that they fit
together efficiently with no gaps or redundancies. Various systems and
databases are needed throughout the process. A general principle is to
reuse processes and technology across many statistical business
processes, so existing production solutions (e.g.~services, systems and
databases) should be examined first, to determine whether they are fit
for purpose for this specific process, then, if any gaps are identified,
new solutions should be designed. This sub-process also considers how
staff will interact with systems, and who will be responsible for what
and when''. (UNECE, 2013)

  This section deals with fitting together the various components of
  the design into a coherent whole. It also includes the design of the
  quality assurance processes through which statistics should be
  evaluated for quality.
\item
  The gathering and harmonisation of data on displaced people are the
  key to international comparative analysis and policy work on forced
  displacement. The timely, accurate statistical information on IDP,
  asylum and refugee statistics enables a wide range of policy answer
  in the rapidly evolving forced displacement caused by humanitarian
  crises.
\item
  The objectives of this IDP, asylum and refugee-related statistical
  production system is to improve efficiency of data and metadata
  collection, validation, processing, storage and dissemination. It is
  also a target of a well-functioning statistical production system to
  improve quality by eliminating errors and incoherencies, and by
  shortening the statistical publication cycles. The accessibility and
  visibility of the asylum related statistical outputs should also be
  a key objective.
\item
  In order to achieve these targets a modern statistical production
  system should utilize of advances of modern information technologies
  and standards.

\subsubsection{The statistical production environment}\label{the-statistical-production-environment}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{271}
\item
  Before developing a statistical production system, the data sources
  of this system should be determined. Based on their supervising body
  in the national data production system, there are two types of data
  sources which can feed these systems.
\item
  The first type is part of the national statistical system, this is
  the administrative data source where the data owners are an
  integrated part of the national public administration. In this case
  the country's government with its public administration is present
  and a national legislation is available which regulates the asylum
  procedure or IDP registration. Parallel to the national legislation
  are specialized administrative bodies or custodian agencies
  responsible for the IDP or asylum procedure and for the collection
  of the administrative data related to the procedures.
\item
  In this case the statistical data are by-products of the
  administrative procedure. In an optimal situation the IDP or asylum
  procedures are supported by IT-systems, and case-management systems
  where the data are stored and can be queried. This case-management
  system is interlinked with a statistical sub-system, it means that
  the case-management system should have an interface where the
  statistical queries can be set. In this production system chain the
  case-management system is the input for the statistical subsystem,
  it is not part of the statistical data production system.
\item
  The statistical sub-system should ensure the ideal technical
  environment for data production and for the metadata production
  environment as well. The statistical production system should have
  also a link to the data storage warehouse, which is a dedicated part
  of the statistical production system. In the storage system the data
  are stored, if possible, in so called cubes, these cubes should have
  a link to the dissemination system which enables the statistical
  data publication via user interfaces. According to the methodology
  of the data inquiry we can differentiate between static systems
  where the data can be requested via static tables e.g.~Excel tables
  or html tables. The other way is to enable the compilation of
  user-friendly, interactive statistical tables.
\item
  The second type of data source describes an IDP or asylum system
  where the national legislation is not so well developed as in the
  first case, and a dedicated governmental custodian body for the
  asylum procedure is not functional. Refugee status-determinations
  can be undertaken by UNHCR in contrast to status determination
  carried out by a government. In the latter case the responsible
  agency for the asylum procedure is an international UN organisation
  such as UNWRA or UNHCR. The data source is the administrative system
  of this international organization which collects data related to
  the IDP or asylum procedure and also disseminates statistics at the
  international level.
\item
  If such an asylum related statistical system is available, the
  international organization serves as the producer of the input for
  the national public administration. A memorandum of agreement could
  enhance the cooperation between organizations of public
  administration and the UNHCR which is directly involved in providing
  shelter for asylum seekers and refugees and in data collection (see
  Part 2 \emph{UNHCR Agreements and Memoranda of Understanding} for an
  example of this).
\end{enumerate}

\begin{verbatim}
'*UNHCR collects data on persons in concern i.e. refugees,
asylum-seekers, internally displaced persons (IDPs), returnees and
stateless persons. The data collection includes information on
country of origin and of asylum, sex age and location or settlement
such as camp or centre. Furthermore, information about protection
and living conditions is also gathered with variables such as
education, health, nutrition as well as information regarding sexual
and gender-based violence.*'[^17]
\end{verbatim}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{277}

\item
  The main obstacle to data collection is the lack of harmonised
  definitions and measurement criteria which can occur in cases when
  the country did not comply with the 1951 Geneva Convention relating
  to the Status of Refugees (See IRRS Chapter 2), or in the case of
  IDPs observe the \emph{Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement}\footnote{E/CN.4/1998/53/Add.2, 11 February 1998, UN Commission on Human
    Rights, Report of the Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr.
    Francis M. Deng, submitted pursuant to Commission resolution
    1997/39. Addendum: Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement,
    available at: \url{https://goo.gl/GJU2Sz}}
  The lack of harmonisation can be especially problematic if the
  translation of definitions of the convention into national law is
  not done in a systematic and harmonised way, and not in observance
  of the Recommendations set out in the IRRS or IRIS. Other factors
  which can make the data collection difficult are differences in
  quality and periodicity.

\item
  When establishing a statistical production system there are also
  some criteria related to the technical details and functionalities
  of the system which should be analysed more detailed. It is
  recommended to develop a common hosting environment for production
  databases, the idea behind the common production system is that it
  strengthens standardisation of the statistical data production and
  it minimises the number of tools used in statistical activities and
  reduces training and support requirements.
\item
  It is recommended that the statistical data production system
  should include a toolkit which enables the management of statistical
  data, this toolkit should include different facilities, such as:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  data migration\footnote{Source: OECD Statistical Information System (SIS)

  metadata management system.
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}

\item
  When planning a statistical data production system, it is essential
  to design a centralized metadata storage system which enhances the
  efficiency of metadata preparation, storage, access, management and
  dissemination. The centralized metadata system addresses the
  problems of fragmented metadata located in numerous databases. The
  metadata sub-system of the statistical production system should meet
  some basic expectations, such as:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  the metadata system should have a common structure, defining common
  metadata items,
\item
  all statistical data should have appropriate metadata,
\item
  it should cover a broad group of user needs,
\item
  the metadata must be consistent across the different subject matter
  areas.
\item
  The metadata system should accommodate any kind of metadata related
  to the corresponding statistical data.
\end{itemize}

Eurostat's Single Integrated Metadata Structure (SIMS)\footnote{Source: European Commission, Technical Manual of the Single
  Integrated Metadata Structure (SIMS):

  downloaded: 03\textsuperscript{rd} June 2019}

The Single Integrated Metadata Structure is the dynamic inventory of
statistical concepts used for quality and metadata reporting in the
European Statistical System.

The Single Integrated Metadata Structure streamlines and harmonises
metadata and quality reporting in the European Statistical System (ESS)
and it decreases the reporting burden on the statistical authorities by
creating the framework for ``once for all purposes''. It is an integrated
quality and metadata reporting framework, which ensures a flexible and
up to date system where future extensions are possible.

The system enables that the same concept names and the same quality
indicators are used in the different ESS metadata structures, it also
enhances the consistency with the SDMX statistical standards as it
stands in the SDMX Content-oriented Guidelines.

It has to be underlined that data users and data producers have
different needs on statistical information and this has to be reflected
by the quality reports that are addressed to them. The distinction
between the user and producer oriented quality reporting is assured
through the Single Integrated Metadata Structure.

Based on this approach there are two different quality reporting systems
available within the SIMS, the user-(U) and producer (P) --oriented
quality reporting. The short user-oriented quality report is implemented
through the improved visibility and readability of the quality related
concepts and the producer-oriented quality report (P) is implemented via
the ESQRS\footnote{\textbf{ESS Standard for Quality Reports Structure}} report structure.

  It is essential that the design of the statistical production
  system (the statistical production database) should interlinked with

\item
  For the dissemination system the data source is the statistical
  production system, the production database, it increases the
  efficiency of statistical dissemination and reduces the risk of
  mistakes, enables more timely publication of statistics.
\item
  The improved statistical dissemination system ensures a common
  layout and reduces the number of different software applications in
  use. The recommended statistical publication tool should have an
  interface for managing publication contents definition and it is
  also necessary to have an interface for generating XML output file
  in order to combine statistical data and metadata.
\item
  A workflow model should be developed which monitors the complex
  statistical data production from the production of statistical data
  to the production of metadata, through the storage of the
  statistical data. This complex model also monitors the statistical
  channels used for monitors.

\setcounter{enumi}{285}
\item
  In order to measure the effectiveness of the statistical production
  system and workflow an indicator system should be established which
  can measure the effectiveness of the statistical production with
  indicators like, soundness of the implementation, the cost
  effectiveness, accuracy and reliability, timeliness and punctuality
  and last but not least accessibility and clarity.
\item
  A suitable indicator system can be seen in the table below, in the
  following this indicator system is presented: the indicator
  soundness of implementation measures the quality of the workflow in
  the design and production system phase of the GSBPM structure. It
  identifies the different sub-processes being part of this phase. The
  soundness of implementation should take into consideration the types
  of the data which are processed (admin data or survey type data) in
  this phase, because it affects the specifications of the indicator
  system.
\item
  It should be also outlined that the cost of designing a statistical
  production system plays an important role, it is necessary to reduce
  the costs of the different software tools. In order to achieve this
  goal, the best solution is the use of common applications. The
  products should be disseminated (see also Phase 7 \emph{Dissemination})
  on an appropriate platform, e.g.~on the home page of the body
  responsible for statistical data production which can also increase
  the costs of the statistical production but using optimal software
  and technical solutions this cost can be reduced.
\item
  The indicator `accuracy and reliability' measures the ratio of
  quality indicators used as performance indicators, the source data,
  integrated data, intermediate results and statistical outputs should
  be regularly assessed and validated.
\item
  The next indicator, `timeliness and punctuality' defines the time
  frame which is available for the production in the different
  sub-processes.
\item
  According to the last indicator in the list, `accessibility and
  clarity', the number of visitors of the home page or other social
  media products of the statistical data producer is calculated.
  During the performance of this statistical data production system a
  quality indicator system can ensure a permanent feedback on the
  production system.

This sub-process also includes preparing and testing the contents and

\end{verbatim}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{298}
\item
  The face-to-face interview methods used paper questionnaire in most
  countries historically. However, as a result of advances in
  technology, new ways of enumerating populations have been
  introduced. The traditional method of enumerating the population
  with face-to-face interviews can now be applied with the use of
  handheld electronic devices or the telephone to automatically
  capture data during the interview. These approaches can either
  substitute or complement the traditional face-to-face, pen-and paper
  interviews (PAPI) and can also be used in a variety of combinations
  (multi-mode method).
\item
  Advantages of the PAPI method: This is the most common method,
  especially in developing countries and in population groups with
  significant illiteracy rates. Data obtained from this method are
  potentially more complete and accurate because of the interaction
  between the enumerator and the respondent, and the opportunity to
  clarify some of the questions and probe for more adequate answers;
\item
  Disadvantages of the PAPI method: The data collection phase of the
  survey may take longer (or require a larger interviewing force)
  compared to other modes of collection, because in-person
  interviewers typically operate alone with much less supervision and
  control, whereas CAP has some built controls. There may be greater
  interviewer variance in in-person interviews and there are also
  greater opportunities for interviewer falsification of some
  questionnaire items or for entire interviews.

  In computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI), the enumerator
  obtains information from one or more household members through an
  interview using an electronic questionnaire (CAPI software
  application) loaded on a tablet or other handheld electronic device
  (e.g.~PDAs and laptops). The enumerator asks the respondent
  questions in a face-to-face interview and the responses are recorded
  by the enumerator directly into the electronic device. Following the
  interview, the data are sent to a central computing network
  electronically via internet or other means of data transfer.
\item
  Advantages of the CAPI method:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{verbatim}
1.  Cost savings in data processing;

2.  Improved quality of data mainly due to the possibility of having
    electronic checks, managed skip patterns are managed and the
    possibility of tailoring questions.

3.  Shorter timelines for completion of data processing;

4.  Improve monitoring of fieldwork and enables more efficient
    management of interviewers, i.e. use of CAPI allows for a
    detailed analysis of the time duration for completing the
    questionnaire, as well as updating enumerators' assignments and
    checking of the completed questionnaires by the supervisors.

  \textbf{A communication plan} must be developed in advance in order to
  explain the purpose of the survey to the respondents. The aim of a
  communication and publicity program is to support the operation of
  the survey and obtain a high-quality result through the following
  measures:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Organizing a recruitment campaign for field staff, and in particular
  members of displaced groups to join the field force.
\item
  Getting information about the reactions to the survey plans and
  activities from displaced people
\item
  Organizing an awareness campaign to:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Maximize awareness of when the survey will be carried out,
  \item
    Promote awareness of procedures and ways to get assistance with
    the survey topics,
  \item
    Address any issues that need clarification, and in particular
    addressing the needs of displaced people,
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Contacting organisations and community groups relevant to displaced
  people in order to get the full cooperation of respondents, and in
  particular building trust in the data collection activities and the
  uses of the data.
\item
  Encourage respondents to cooperate to the best of their ability, and
  to ensure the salience of the topics to the displaced people to be
  interviewed.

  \textbf{Ethical aspects and vulnerable respondents}. Interviewing
  Refugees or IDPs presents sensitivities, as any IDP or Refugee who
  identifies themselves as such could face threats from doing so or be
  stigmatised. The displaced population has special needs or
  conditions of interview, and the `no-harm' principles and UN ethical
  standards on data collection and data protection must be applied.
  All enumerators, coordinators, data managers, and anyone involved in
  the development of the official statistics must be aware and follows
  such principles. (See e.g.~\href{https://publications.iom.int/books/iom-data-protection-manual}{IOM data protection

  \textbf{Test collection tools} on a number of units before the pilot

  a small number of units to make sure that the questions are well
  formulated, coherent and well sequenced. If using CAPI the
  collection program should be tested, and any bugs identified before
  the pilot survey. Some points to consider are:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{verbatim}
18. How the respondents interpret the questions and are required to
    think to come up with an answer.

19. Clarity of the questions.

20. The processing capacity of the technology (long questionnaires
    may require a lot processor capacity and internal memory of the
    device used, especially as the interview often needs to run
    applications for maps and interview administration
    simultaneously).

21. Need to adapt the questions to the country context (i.e. taking
    into account ethno-cultural characteristics and potentially
    sensitive topics for vulnerable groups).

22. Sending out the final version of the questionnaire to the

  The transmission of the data must make use of secure channels, using
  IT encryption and state-of-the-art data security standards. This is
  particularly important when dealing with vulnerable respondents
  where data security breaches may impact on their safety and
  security.
\item
  \textbf{Testing of data treatment tools:} The data processing involves a
  series of steps to convert the responses to the electronic
  questionnaire from their raw format to a high-quality user-friendly
  database with a comprehensive set of variables for the analysis. The
  processing tools consist mainly of data capture and editing software
  including the SCPRO developed by US Census, SPSS, and of course
  Excel. After collecting and entering data, several test operations
  are performed to remove errors in the files, to check the data to
  assess whether or not errors are of sufficient magnitude to impact
  on the results, to ensure consistency, code open questions, create
  variables useful for the analysis of data. and, finally, systematize
  and document variables to facilitate their use for analytical
  purposes.
\item
  \textbf{Testing of dissemination tools:} All information gains value
  through its use. This is to test the media that will be used to
  ensure the dissemination of data. This may be a program designed to
  make the case of Cameroon accessible to the database or to the data
  file, such as ANADOC. Other media to be tested may be the
  capabilities and quality of the CD-room and USB key, the mock-ups of
  the leaflets and brochures as well as the report formats.

\paragraph{Ensuring Collaboration by Households}\label{ensuring-collaboration-by-households}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{322}
\item
  The most important way to ensure collaboration by the households is
  to establish a good with local communities about the purpose and
  conduct of the survey. Efforts may be needed at the national, local
  and particularly at the community level. The survey should use
  polite, diligent, well trained interviewers and to ensure that the
  household is contacted and a time convenient for the interview
  arranged. Some additional measures may be needed. There are no fixed
  prescriptions that will work everywhere, but experience from various
  countries should be observed and evaluated.
\item
  \textbf{Use of Mass Media}. In general, the use of mass media is a waste
  of money because the mass media reach many people whom the survey
  does not. However, if mass media coverage can be obtained free it
  can be useful. Even if it is limited to a short newspaper story or
  some radio or TV briefs at the start of the survey, it can boost the
  field teams' morale and self-confidence at this critical time.
  (Occasionally Interviewers keep the old newspapers throughout the
  entire survey period, to show the households that they are official
  and serious.)
\item
  \textbf{Targeted Publicity}. This may include letters to the households
  and leaflets (preferably in colour, with graphs or other
  illustrations) that explain the purpose of the survey and the
  sampling methodology in simple terms.
\item
  \textbf{Material Incentives}. Sometimes a gift or payment is given to
  the households in return for their collaboration. There is some
  controversy about the quality and quantity of the material
  incentives that should be used to foster the household's
  collaboration. Some consider incentives to be standard procedure for
  all surveys. Other statistical agencies are reluctant to even
  consider the idea of rewarding the households in any way, to prevent
  households from becoming increasingly demanding and affecting all
  the household surveys conducted in the country. A relatively
  inexpensive alternative, likely to be cost-effective and be accepted
  in all countries, consists of giving away small presents for the
  interviewed households. Ideally, the giveaways should have little or
  no intrinsic value. This both ensures that they do not affect the
  household welfare measurement and reduces the accounting controls
  required.
\item
  \textbf{Community Level.} Publicity and motivation at the local
  community level are especially important in rural areas. Local
  authorities should be contacted and convinced of the usefulness of
  the survey. After this meeting the Interviewers can contact the
  selected households to introduce themselves and to make appointments
  for interviews. As an example, when doing a pilot survey in an IDP
  camp in Darfur, Al-Fasher, the field teams failed to approach the
  traditional leaders. This almost compromised the fieldwork
  operation. The problem was exacerbated as local IDPs were not
  approached or recruited to join the fieldwork team although this may
  have raised some problems over confidentiality, roles for local
  people in field operations may be advantageous in gaining local
  support .
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{survey-instrument-preparation}{%
\paragraph{Survey Instrument Preparation}\label{survey-instrument-preparation}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{327}
\item
  The survey data collection phase requires the preparation of the
  survey instrument and the design of the questionnaire to be
  administered to respondents (see also \emph{Phase 3} \emph{Build a system for
  collection of data and production of statistics}). There are two
  methods of administering household survey questionnaires: Paper and
  Pencil Interviewing (PAPI) and electronic data capture. PAPI uses
  paper questionnaires for interviews and the data can be recorded in
  two ways: i) data entered in a central location, and ii) data
  entered in the field, known as Computer Assisted Field Entry (CAFE).
  CAFE is preferable because it facilitates electronic data checks
  while data collection is ongoing, which could improve data quality.
  Data checks are performed during fieldwork, thus allowing for the
  possibility of correcting the data while Interviewers and
  respondents are still available. If any errors are flagged during
  field entry, the Interviewer can return to the household the next
  day to revise and/or make necessary corrections.
\item
  Electronic data capture can be done in a variety of ways: 1)
  Computer Assisted Personal Interview (CAPI), which uses tablets; 2)
  Computer Assisted Web Interview (CAWI), which is typically conducted
  via email and might not be feasible for certain populations because
  it is self-administered; and 3) Computer Assisted Telephone
  Interview (CATI) in which the data is collected over the phone and
  therefore has a time constraint.
\item
  CAPI is increasingly becoming the survey instrument of choice as it
  allows for faster data collection and better-quality data, by
  allowing for immediate in situ data validity checks. The decision to
  use CAPI will depend on the capabilities of the organization that
  collects the data and the interests of the organization that
  finances the data collection. Such capabilities are measured in
  terms of: (a) technical ability, i.e.~skilled data programmers and
  Interviewers; (b) the communications system and infrastructure;
  and (c) the ease of access to the equipment, given the procurement
  procedures.
\item
  Field work using either paper questionnaires and CAFE; or tablets
  and CAPI face constraints while in the field, and this can be
  particularly problematic in situations of disaster or displacement.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{verbatim}
1.  First, without access to electricity, it will be difficult to
    operate the data entry computer. Options to resolve this problem
    include providing each team with a set of solar panels,
    high-performance batteries, or other electronic equipment. In
    addition to the electronic equipment, the teams have to
    transport the computer itself, the printer and a sufficient
    supply of paper, diskettes, and so forth. The advantage is that
    this will allow proven field and data entry procedures to be
    used with only minor modification. The modifications that are
    being made relate mostly to reducing the amount of paper used in
    the supervision and data management process, in order to reduce
    the weight that has to be carried around. The main disadvantages
    of this approach to mobile data entry are the risk of something
    going wrong with such an elaborate setup and the weight the
    teams will have to carry.

2.  Second, if there is no electricity, recharging the batteries for
    the tablets used for CAPI collection can be affected. A supply
    of extra batteries should be provided to each team, however in
    situations where this cannot be easily or safely done PAPI
    methods may be preferable

3.  Finally, the lack of Wi-Fi access can have serious adverse
    effects on the data collection whether CAFÉ or CAPI is used.
    Sending data for central processing over the internet can help
    speed up overall completion of the survey implementation. If
    CAFÉ is used, the Data Entry Operator can send data to
    headquarters as soon as all the checks have been completed. If
    CAPI is used, it may, depending on the software used, require
    internet connectivity to implement the questionnaire. With
    either method, having WIFI connections allows the teams to stay
    in the field for longer periods of time without having to go to
    headquarters to deliver data.

\item
  The pilot test for field procedures is less to determine whether
  they can work in general than to fine tune the details of how they
  are implemented in the specific country. Most problems found during
  the field test fall into three classes:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{verbatim}
4.  **Refining Logistics**. In spite of careful planning, some
    problems regarding the supply of one survey materials is always
    found.

5.  **Debugging the Data Entry Programme.** The functioning of the
    data entry program has to be tested. Despite extensive testing
    problems arise when data from numerous real households are
    entered. Additional consistency checks are likely to be required
    that were unforeseen by the survey Data Managers. These will
    become obvious after the first few days or hours of field work,
    early field tests are particularly useful.

6.  **Statistical Quality Control of the Data**. Concurrent data
    entry makes it possible to conduct some preliminary statistical
    analysis of the data collected as the survey progresses. From an
    analytical standpoint, the data from just a portion of the field
    work has no statistical significance unless the total sample is
    exceptionally large, but it often can provide interesting
    insights into the quality of the field work. For instance, after
    the first period of field work, the frequency distribution of
    the last digit of the ages recorded in years may show too large
    a proportion of \"zeroes\" and \"fives\" (demographers always
    expect this to happen, but it should always be checked). The
    early detection of this problem allows for corrective
    re-training and can also give the data entry program credibility
    in the eyes of the field teams.

  Regular supervision that includes practical suggestions to

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{333}
\item
  Prior to data collection, the training plan for both the field
  staff and the management staff should be laid out. Normally this
  will include training in the techniques required to collect the data
  required or to compile the data. In addition, if an instrument will
  be used in the field, then specific training runs of deploying the
  instrument are necessary.
\item
  Hiring good field workers is often difficult. Because it is often
  difficult to assess all the required qualities in a short job
  interview, more field staff should be hired than will be required,
  usually 15 to 25 percent more. All the hires are trained. During the
  training period the candidates' work characteristics and ability to
  establish rapport with interviewees is displayed and can be assessed
  more accurately. Then, after the training period, a final selection
  is made.
\item
  Good training contributes greatly to the quality of the data
  collection effort. Training is one of the hardest aspects of field
  work to convince people to do well. Training is expensive, takes
  time away from actual collection of data, and is often viewed as an
  unnecessarily complicated task. The most common complaint is that
  the Interviewers already know how to interview and there is little
  need for additional training.
\item
  Having Interviewers who are previously trained in how to interview
  can be an advantage. Interviewing techniques are difficult to
  learn - how to interact with the respondents, how to convince
  reluctant respondents to participate and actually complete the
  interview, how to get the attention of the respondents when they
  have so many other things to do - and are useful in almost all
  survey situations, regardless of the contents of the questionnaire.
\item
  However, initially the Interviewers do not know the reasons for
  this particular survey, the contents of this questionnaire, the
  analyses that are envisioned for the data or the policy impacts that
  these data could influence. It is extremely important that enough
  time is given to training on the specifics of the survey so that all
  Interviewers understand the purpose of the survey and all of the
  concepts in the same way. This is particularly important for NSOs
  conducting surveys about displacement for the first time, as many of
  the concepts and definitions are new.

\item
  Many of the concepts in the IRRS and IRIS will be new to
  statistical offices and their staff. All staff involved in any
  survey or data collection involving displaced people must be trained
  in these concepts and understand them. Of particular importance is
  training data collection staff on refugee and IDP concepts such as
  habitual residence, usual residence, migration concepts, refugee
  categories, meaning of displacement, meaning of refugee and IDP, and
  reasons for displacement and migration.
\item
  Many displaced people are difficult to find, as their place of
  residence is often not fixed or is impermanent. They may be in
  shelters, camps, temporary accommodation or lodging with other
  households. Because of this, they may fail the interviewers usual
  understanding of `usual members of the household' and can be treated
  as visitors and excluded from household rosters. These exclusions
  mean that they fail the test of probability sampling, that every
  person has a known chance of selection in the survey. Data
  collection staff must be carefully trained in recording all members
  of the household -- e.g.~temporary members who may be displaced.
\item
  Training in the interviewing of vulnerable persons such as children
  and disabled people. People who have been displaced have suffered
  trauma and any interview may ask people to relive painful
  experiences. A UNHCR commissioned survey of IDPs in Georgia in 2014
  asking about their intentions was described as an emotional
  process\footnote{Source IRRS:

\begin{enumerate}

\setcounter{enumi}{343}
\item
  This section discusses the main features of preparation for field
  work, other than designing the questionnaire or drawing the sample.
  Many of the data quality control mechanisms rely extensively on the
  preparation for the field work. Survey preparation is thus very
  important and should be given due time and attention. Often there is
  the temptation to skimp on preparation in order to move to the field
  too rapidly. This temptation should be avoided.
\item
  The survey's success relies on its staff. Here are some basic
  requirements that staff should have given their role in the data
  collection activities:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{The Survey Manager} should be a social scientist or statistician
  with a grasp of the goals to be achieved by the survey. Often this
  person will have a graduate degree in statistics, economics, or
  demography. At a minimum the Survey Manager should have a lower
  university degree.
\item
  \textbf{The Data Manager} can be a systems analyst or senior programmer
  with prior experience in statistical data management.
\item
  \textbf{The Field Manager} should have substantial managerial skills and
  experience in conducting household surveys in the country. All
  members of the core staff (not just the Data Manager) should be
  familiar enough with personal computers to use word processing
  software and spreadsheets.
\item
  \textbf{The Supervisors} should have completed secondary education.
  Experience in motivating people and managing resources; and the
  ability to foster teamwork are more important than credentials.
\item
  \textbf{The Interviewers} should also have a good secondary education,
  but they do not need to have pursued further studies. In fact, that
  may be a disadvantage, as graduates tend to be more likely to
  abandon the survey halfway through if they are offered a better or
  more interesting job.
\item
  Similarly, experience with computers is not an essential requisite
  for the \textbf{Data Entry Operators,} but it is helpful if they have
  keyboard skills. It is not difficult to learn to enter data and it
  is not necessary to understand how a program works in order to use
  it successfully. It is better, in fact, if the Data Entry Operators
  are interested in the survey rather than in computers; that way,
  when they note incorrect answers, they are more likely to use the
  same terms as the questionnaire instead of explaining the error in
  computer terms.
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{345}
\item
  It may also be desirable that team members, especially
  Interviewers, be fluent in two or more languages, and in when
  interviewing displaced people interviewers must be fluent in the
  languages and dialects that they are likely to encounter. Moreover,
  it is best if the Interviewers in each team have complementary
  language skills so that between them, so they can conduct all (or
  nearly all) the interviews themselves. \footnote{Output system is considered as a dissemination system (data
    portal, platform, database etc.) which is offered to external/end
    users of the statistical information/products.}
\item
  Unless specific cultural or religious conditions dictate, there
  seems to be no \emph{a priori} reason for preferring male to female
  Interviewers or vice versa. However, this should be adapted to the
  cultural context, e.g.~the NSO in Sudan aims to use male
  interviewers among the nomads, interviewers with military background
  when addressing military personnel, female interviewers when
  interviewing women on pregnancy, birth, breastfeeding etc. There is
  also some anecdotal evidence, that households are less likely to
  refuse women interviewers. Prior experience in the country may show
  that it is culturally more acceptable for female respondents to
  admit female interviewers to their homes when the men were absent.
  Even when male interviewers are used, anecdotal reports from several
  countries suggest that females may find it easier to establish
  rapport for the modules with sensitive content.
\item
  In some surveys, questions may be gendered with sensitive questions
  for males and females, an interviewer should be selected of the same
  gender to enable the interview to obtain the answers needed with as
  little social embarrassment as possible, and in privacy.

  Collecting survey data in hazardous or conflict environments is
  marked by specific situations that may be hard to plan for. Parts of
  a country may be inaccessible due to the presence of terrorist
  groups or violent clashes between various power factions may occur
  throughout the territory. In addition to conflict situations, the
  weather phenomena may cause severe droughts or severe floods that
  exacerbate pre-existing vulnerabilities in the population. Both
  conflict and weather conditions have led to large‐scale internal
  displacement throughout the world.
\item
  Countries with conflict are often data deprived. Specifically,
  years of civil war or ongoing conflict will erode the statistical
  infrastructure and capacity, leading to the lack of key macro‐ and
  micro‐economic indicators. The last full population census, needed
  to develop the sample frame, may be long out of date. In addition,
  risks to the safety of field staff may require spending as little
  time in enumeration areas as possible. While organizations operating
  within the country may implement a range of smaller surveys, these
  cannot meet the data needs for all policy interventions.
\item
  Several techniques have been developed to consider the special
  circumstances of trying to collect data in hazardous or conflict
  situations. To address security concerns, the Somalia High Frequency
  Survey adapted logistical arrangements, sampling strategy, and
  questionnaire design to limit time on the ground. In logistical
  arrangements, a detailed and timely security assessment ensured that
  the enumeration areas to‐be‐visited were safe on the day of
  fieldwork.\footnote{\url{https://unstats.un.org/unsd/dnss/gp/fundprinciples.aspx}} The fieldwork protocol was designed such that teams
  would spend as little time as possible in any given region and draw
  little attention, ensuring enumerator and respondent safety.
  Concerning sampling strategy, it was not feasible to conduct a full
  listing of all households in an enumeration area, as this was too
  time‐intensive and may have raised suspicion. Instead, a
  micro‐listing approach was used, which required enumeration areas to
  be segmented into smaller enumeration blocks using satellite
  imagery. Enumeration blocks are small enough for enumerators to list
  and select households immediately before conducting the interview.
\item
  Other techniques include enlisting the assistance of local
  community groups in conflict areas to assist in the collection of
  the data. Using local community groups who have the trust of the
  group of interest can bridge the communication gap between the data
  collection effort and the conflict area groups. When using this
  technique, it is important that the local community groups are
  contacted early in the survey design process and allowed to
  participate in the preparation of the survey. It is important that
  communities in the conflict areas feel that their concerns have been
  addressed.
\item
  A sufficient initial stock and a steady supply of survey materials
  and inputs should be ensured for all field teams throughout the
  whole survey period. The list of materials includes obvious items
  such as questionnaires/tablets, pencils, and erasers, less obvious
  ones such as USB keys, clipboards, and briefcases, and a myriad of
  country-specific items ranging from raincoats to camping stoves.
\item
  The elements that have proven hardest to manage in all countries
  are fuel, oil, and everything related to car maintenance. Probably
  the best solution is to provide a cash revolving fund and make the
  Supervisor accountable for it. This may be hard to do in more
  bureaucratic organisations.

\paragraph{Conducting the interview}\label{conducting-the-interview}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{354}
\item
  In each interview the Interviewer will go through all pertinent
  modules in the order they appear in the questionnaire. Interviews
  should be conducted with direct respondents as often as possible.
  For those respondents who are too young - children under 10 years of
  age - the adult who is most responsible for the children should
  respond on their behalf. Proxies will also be used for respondents
  who are temporarily absent or who are unable to respond for
  themselves due to illness or disability.
\item
  This practice enhances data quality in several ways. First, since
  the person best qualified to answer each part of the questionnaire
  is interviewed, inaccurate responses are avoided. Second, the whole
  survey, which can take considerable time in each household, is
  broken into a series of more manageable mini-interviews. Respondent
  fatigue is thus minimized. Third, since the mini-interviews are
  scheduled according to the respondents' convenience, the refusal
  rate is also minimized. However mini-interviews can also introduce
  logistical problems for both interviewers and respondents, and the
  context should be taken into account, particularly in hazardous
  environments where travel needs to be minimised.
\item
  The actual length of the interview varies widely from one household
  to another and between countries. The difference between countries
  depends on the length of the questionnaires used. Within countries,
  interview time varies depending on the number of people in the
  household. However, given that Interviewers generally need to visit
  each household several times, it is more useful to evaluate
  interview time (and consequently Interviewer productivity) in terms
  of "households per week" or "households per day" rather in
  "hours per household."
\item
  Field work with simultaneous data entry offers several powerful
  advantages. First and perhaps most important, it raises data
  quality. Simultaneous data entry, whether CAFÉ or CAPI makes it
  possible to correct mistakes while Interviewers are still in the
  household or at least in the area.
\item
  Secondly, simultaneous data entry can also shorten the time needed
  for data entry, and speed up the editing and analysis steps after
  the final interview. Thus, the goal of the timely availability of
  the data is accomplished.
\item
  There are a few disadvantages to this type of field organization.
  For one thing, the field workers need to be highly competent.
  Moreover, this strategy may also increase the survey costs.

\item
  Three of the tasks of the team Supervisors should be supported by
  written documents, known as supervision forms. These are (1)
  Interviewer evaluation, (2) questionnaire verification, and (3)
  check-up interviews. The forms are intended to give these tasks
  formal definition, as opposed to loosely defined responsibilities
  left to the Supervisor's personal initiative, and to make it
  possible to supervise the Supervisors themselves (e.g., make
  supervision tasks verifiable by the survey core staff).

\begin{enumerate}

\item
  The task assignment of each team should be done concurrently with
  the first stage of sample selection. The clusters are distributed
  among the field teams and the order in which each team will visit
  the clusters assigned to it is decided at random. The schedule of
  each team should then be made explicit, to indicate what each team
  will be supposed to be doing each week of the survey year.
\item
  Designing the actual schedule is very country-specific, as it is
  usually developed around national holidays and other significant
  dates, with the goal of either excluding or including them in the
  work period. In Muslim countries, for instance, the Ramadan month is
  particularly interesting to observe because of the differences in
  the household consumption patterns; Ramadan, however, is not a good
  month to train Interviewers or to initiate the survey.

\begin{enumerate}

\setcounter{enumi}{363}
\item
  The key headquarters staff includes the Survey Manager, Data
  Manager, and Field Manager. These are the minimum requirements.
  Sometimes it is useful to employ a secretary and a bookkeeper. The
  need for a bookkeeper will be greater where financing is being
  provided by more than one agency or where substantial procurement
  will take place.
\item
  The core staff should be organized to work together as a team, with
  the Survey Manager being the only head during the entire preparation
  stage instead of having individuals respond to separate divisions in
  the data collection agency. This is especially important - and
  sometimes hard to achieve - in large national statistical agencies
  that are organized under the traditional departmental structure with
  a census department, a household survey department, a data
  processing department, and so forth.
\item
  Each of the field teams is headed by a Supervisor and usually
  includes three to four Interviewers, a driver with a car, and a Data
  Entry Operator if CAPI is not used. This standard setup is used for
  most surveys. In some countries local conditions have dictated
  changes in the composition of the field teams:
\item
  When a team must work mainly in large urban areas, an additional
  Interviewer may sometimes be added. This allows for additional
  interviews to take place at a low marginal cost.
\item
  Cultural constraints in certain countries may require that an adult
  must be interviewed by someone of the same sex. Since it would
  likewise not be appropriate for a female to travel alone with
  several men, each team may need to have two female and two male
  Interviewers. In some cases, a relative of the female Interviewer(s)
  may need to travel with the team.

    Several data limitations prevent an accurate assessment of

\begin{enumerate}

\setcounter{enumi}{372}
\item
  This example describes recoding data to produce statistics on
  refugees in accordance to the IRRS. Since 2017 the German Federal
  Statistical Office compiles statistics on foreigners seeking
  humanitarian protection based on the Central Register on Foreigners
  (CRF). In light of the unprecedented inflow of asylum seekers
  between 2014 and 2016, the Federal Statistical Office explored the
  feasibility of complementing existing statistics on the inflow of
  asylum seekers with figures about the stock of foreigners living in
  Germany for humanitarian reasons. The approach relies mainly on
  administrative residence permit data obtained from the CRF. In
  general, administrative residence status data allows for taking a
  comprehensive view on humanitarian immigration that not only
  includes foreigners with a granted protection status, but also those
  with an asylum application still pending, as well as foreigners who
  remain in the host country after having been denied protection.
  Thereby, administrative data allows for producing official
  statistics that follow the International Recommendations for Refugee
  Statistics (IRRS) that were adopted by the United Nations
  Statistical Commission in March 2018.
\item
  A necessary first step is to understand the scope of the
  administrative data at hand. In Germany, the CRF is the central
  database for all authorities responsible for administrative
  procedures concerning foreigners. It contains basic personal
  information on foreigners from EU member countries; additional
  information on legal residence status for foreigners from Non-EU
  countries; and even more detailed information (e.g.~on educational
  background and language skills) on foreigners seeking asylum in
  Germany. Most importantly for classifying refugees and people in
  refugee like situations, the CRF centrally collects all information
  concerning foreigners' legal residence status (e.g.~current
  residence permit) that is locally produced by immigration offices.
  As an important limitation, the register only covers foreigners.
  Once a person receives German citizenship, s/he is immediately
  deleted from the register. Hence, second generation and former
  refugees who acquired German citizenship cannot be identified with
  the data at hand.
\item
  In many countries, including Germany, residence and asylum law is
  excessively complex. When classifying foreigners seeking protection,
  numerous types of residence permits, and a wide range of additional
  legal statuses must be considered. Accordingly, filtering and
  structuring the relevant legal information that reliably identify
  the target population is key in compiling statistics on refugees and
  people in refugee like situations from administrative data. The data
  usually does not come in a form that is ready for use for
  statistical purposes. Before foreigners seeking protection can be
  identified in the data, the various variables related to the legal
  residence status must be consolidated. In this process the relevant
  legal status for each person in the register is determined. For
  instance, consider a Croatian citizen who fled persecution during
  the war for independence from Yugoslavia in the early 1990s.
  Further, imagine this person receives a permanent humanitarian
  residence permit in Germany. Even three decades later, this
  residence permit is still valid and recorded in the register.
  However, it is no longer relevant for this person, since Croatia
  became a member of the European Union in 2013 and meanwhile Croatian
  citizens enjoy the right of free movement in Germany.

\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{375}
\item
  Building upon the consolidated legal residence status, the target
  population can be classified. People seeking humanitarian protection
  constitute a sub-group of the foreign population who specifically
  refer to humanitarian reasons for their current stay in Germany.
  This population in turn consists of three distinct sub-groups that
  are distinguished by whether their request for humanitarian
  protection is yet unsettled, granted or denied.
\item
  A foreigner's purpose of residence is inferred from his/her legal
  residence status. One necessary precondition for identifying
  foreigners with a granted protection status is that residence
  permits reveal the underlying purpose of residence. In Germany,
  information on the purpose of residence can be deduced from a
  foreigner's current residence permit since in 2005 the German
  Residence Act became effective. Since then residence permits
  distinguish between residence either for educational purposes, for
  the purpose of economic activity, for family reasons or based on
  humanitarian grounds. Residence permits based on humanitarian
  grounds can either be temporary or permanent.
\item
  Besides foreigners already holding a humanitarian residence permit,
  asylum-seekers residing in Germany who intend acquiring a
  humanitarian residence permit also belong to the stock of foreigners
  seeking protection. Foreigners with an unsettled protection status
  have either expressed a request for asylum towards German
  authorities (e.g.~police or immigration office) or they already
  filed an asylum application at the Federal Office for Migration and
  Refugees.
\item
  Foreigners whose asylum applications were denied but who still
  reside in Germany constitute the third final sub-group of foreigners
  whose request for humanitarian protection has been denied. The
  sub-group of foreigners with a denied protection status also
  includes foreigners who previously held a temporary humanitarian
  residence permit that was either not prolonged, renounced or
  withdrawn. All foreigners belonging to this category are legally
  obliged to leave the country. However, in many cases this obligation
  cannot be enforced due to practical (e.g.~missing passports) or
  legal (e.g.~family ties) reasons leading to prolonged durations of
  stay in this status.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{384}
\item
  Reviewing data quality after a mass influx of asylum seekers
  requires special attention. Data quality issues in administrative
  data occur in particular during periods of mass influx when
  administrative procedures are overburdened with the large numbers of
  incoming asylum-seekers. When the increase in asylum applications is
  sudden and unexpected, it is difficult to scale-up existing
  administrative capacities for registration and refugee status
  determination. As a result, data quality in administrative registers
  is often poorest when the demand for data on refugees is highest.
  Reviewing and validating the available data becomes a crucial task
  for statisticians in those times, since they must judge whether data
  quality is sufficient for the production of official statistics.
  When using administrative data in immediate response to a mass
  influx, statisticians should look out for;
\item
  \textbf{Delayed registrations:} In response to humanitarian crises,
  organizing shelter and covering basic needs is a host country's
  first priority. Refugee status determination comes afterwards.
  During periods of mass influx, asylum seekers may face prolonged
  waiting periods for officially lodging their asylum applications.
  Where asylum seekers are properly registered only after having
  lodged their asylum application, administrative registers will cover
  the newly arrived only with considerable time lack.
\item
  \textbf{Incomplete and false registrations:} Intending to assist
  overburdened immigration authorities, governments improvise and
  deviate from traditional workflows during periods of mass influx.
  Registration is then often no longer carried out by trained
  personnel in immigration offices but mobile registration units with
  the support of the armed forces and the police register asylum
  seekers in temporary accommodations or even in improvised reception
  facilities on the road. Considering that untrained staff registers
  displaced people who often lack official documents, incomplete and
  false registrations are hardly surprising.
\item
  \textbf{Multiple registrations:} When asylum seekers are distributed
  within the host country for accommodation, small differences in
  spelling or translations often cause double registration. Language
  barriers are especially problematic when translations between
  different alphabets are involved e.g.~between the Arabic, Cyrillic
  and Latin alphabet. While taking and comparing fingerprint scans
  would solve most of the problem, the infrastructure is not always in
  place. Once entered in the register, duplicate entries are difficult
  to identify with certainty and can thus be expected to bias results
  for a prolonged period.

  Computing variables for measuring integration and the satisfaction
  of immediate and on-going needs of refugees and refugee related
  populations are set out at length in IRRS, 2018 Chapter 5. Further
  discussion of the indicators used to measure European refugee
  integration can be found at link

\item
  Both the IRRS in Chapter 5, and IRIS in Chapter 4 Section B,
  discuss the use of the SDGs indicators for measuring the
  satisfaction of basic and immediate needs of displaced people, and
  measuring their progress towards integration or durable solutions.

'``n this phase, statistical outputs are produced, examined in detail and
made ready for dissemination. It includes preparing statistical content
(including commentary, technical notes, etc.), and ensuring outputs are
"fit for purpose" prior to dissemination to customers. This phase also
includes the sub-processes and activities that enable statistical
analysts to understand the statistics produced. For statistical outputs
produced regularly, this phase occurs in every iteration. The
"Analyse" phase and sub-processes are generic for all statistical
outputs, regardless of how the data were sourced\footnote{\textsuperscript{Ibid~para~94}}''. (UNECE, 2013)

  This section of the Compilers' Manual provides detailed guidance on
  the analysis required to produce the outputs specified in Phase 2.1
  Design Outputs (see paragraph 611). The outputs for displacement
  statistics can be divided into four categories;
\end{enumerate}

\begin{verbatim}
1.  Basic tabulations - estimates of counts and proportions of
    stocks and flows

2.  Basic indicators (statistics, proportions and estimates)

3.  SDG indicators recommended for refugees and IDPs

4.  More complex analysis and commentary which might include an
    analysis of the integration of displaced people into host
    communities, the progress made towards overcoming key
    displacement-related vulnerabilities, and other key policy
    issues.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{396}
\item
  Taking point iv, the more complex analysis, the different
  indicators specified to measure aspects of displacement and
  integration are based on the indicator libraries of the \emph{Integrated
  Household Survey Framework and the Durable Solution project}, as
  well as the recommended indicators included in the IRRS and IRIS.
  They include linkages to SDGs and form part of the reporting of the
  progress towards meeting the SDGs. In addition, analysis will
  measure progress towards durable solutions for IDPs, and of the
  integration for refugees into their host communities. It will also
  include the assessment of the end of IDP status for some members of
  the IDP stocks.
\item
  The analysis process includes two steps:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{verbatim}
5.  Utilizes the analytical framework specified in Phase 2.1
    "Design" to produce the statistical outputs required,

6.  Interpretation, commentary and checking the outputs.

  In essence, it covers the steps required to convert data into a

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{401}
\item
  Phase 2 Design defines stocks and flows. A stock corresponds to an
  already-defined category of individuals and refers to a set of
  characteristics. A stock refers to the total number of individuals
  who have a specific set of characteristics, at a specific moment in
  time. These characteristics, put together, define the status of
  these individuals.
\item
  For example, IDPs have a specific set of characteristics, which
  make them fit into this category. This is mainly the forced nature
  of their displacement, its origin being the habitual place of
  residence of the concerned persons or groups, the movement remaining
  within internationally recognised borders and the individuals having
  not yet found a durable solution to their displacement.
\item
  In contrast a refugee has been forcibly displaced by reason of a
  well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion,
  nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political
  opinion and is \emph{``outside the country of his or her nationality, has
  crossed an internationally recognised border, and is unable to,
  owing to such a fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the
  protection of that country''}\footnote{Source IRRS:
    \url{https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/3859598/9315869/KS-GQ-18-004-EN-N.pdf/d331c9cc-1091-43c2-b589-2c250bccc281}
    - page 125.} in need of international
  protection. The statistical categories recommended go beyond these
  definitions, in order to classify those with a refugee or IDP
  background and second-generation populations for statistical
  analysis (see relevant Chapters 3 in both IRRS, 2018 and IRIS,
  2020).
\item
  Flows affect this stock over time, either by making it increase
  (``in-flows'') or decrease (``out-flows''). This in-flow corresponds to
  the number of individuals who acquire the characteristics of those
  in scope of the stock during a specified time period. For out-flows,
  it is the number of people who cease to be refugees or IDPs, e.g.~by
  changes in status, death, birth or out-migration.
\item
  There can also be in-flows and out-flows between the sub-stocks,
  for example an asylum seeker who is granted refugee status is an
  outflow from the sub-stock of `Asylum seekers', and an inflow into
  `Persons with determined status' (see IRRS, Figure 3.1). Therefore,
  there can be several stocks and flows, corresponding to the various
  classifications of populations being analysed. If the stocks are
  interconnected, i.e.~if a person or group move from one status to
  another, the flows can also be interconnected; the out-flow from one
  stock can be the in-flow into another stock.
\item
  \textbf{The basic tabulations of refugee and refugee related stocks and
  flows} are set out in Phase 2 \emph{2.1.1. Refugee statistics outputs}
  in Table 2.1 Basic Refugee Stock Tabulations and Table 2.2 Basic
  Refugee Flow Tabulations.
\item
  \textbf{The basic tabulations of IDPs and IDP related stocks and flows}
  are set out in Phase 2 \emph{2.1.2. IDP statistics outputs} in Table
  2.5 - Basic IDP Flow Tabulations, which covers both outflows and
  inflows to the IDP and IDP-related stock, and Table 2.6 IDP Stock
  Tabulations.
\item
  These stock tabulations include both i) IDPs, ii) IDP-Related and
  iii). Those Who Have Overcome Key Displacement-Related
  Vulnerabilities. Some analysis will be required to identify the
  stock of the third category, and to estimate the flows of those who
  have been removed from the IDP stock because they \emph{have overcome key
  displacement-related vulnerabilities.} Analysis will be needed to
  derive the variable in the databases which enables the analyst to
  identify those who have overcome those vulnerabilities, and to
  remove them statistically from stock. This is identification process
  described below in \emph{section} \emph{0,} but it should be noted that the
  full methodology for determining IDPs to be removed from stock is in
  its early stages. A more developed methodology will be added to
  future editions of this manual.

  `In light of the mass influx between 2014 and 2016, the Federal
  Statistical Office of Germany explored the feasibility of
  complementing existing statistics on the inflow of refugees derived
  from asylum applications with information on the stock of foreigners
  living in Germany for humanitarian reasons. The concept was designed
  to take a comprehensive approach by not only including foreigners
  with a granted protection status but also foreigners with an asylum
  application still pending as well as foreigners who still remain in
  Germany after having been refused protection. Thereby, the approach
  follows the International Recommendations for Refugee Statistics
  that were recently adopted by the United Nations Statistical
  Commission. The concept relies on residence permit data obtained
  from the Central Register of Foreigners. This data allows
  identifying foreigners currently applying as well as foreigners
  having been granted or denied humanitarian protection. At the end of
  2016, about 1.6 million foreigners were identified as seeking
  humanitarian protection in Germany. That represents about 2 percent
  of the resident population and about 16 \% of all resident
  foreigners. During to the recent surge in humanitarian immigration
  to Germany between 2014 and 2016, the stock has more than
  doubled'\footnote{Output system is considered as a dissemination system (data
    portal, platform, database etc.) which is offered to external/end
    users of the statistical information/products.}.

  forcibly displaced populations, including IDPs. However, the issue
  cuts across many SDGs, and multiple indicators can be disaggregated
  by migratory status and, more specifically, by displacement status.
  When SDG indicators are collected as part of statistics on forced
  displacement it is recommended that countries use the SDG framework
  and metadata in developing the statistics.

  The Inter-Agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators accepted the
  proposal of EGRIS members to recommend disaggregation by forced
  displacement categories for 12 priority SDG indicators, as well as
  further broken down by age and sex whenever possible.\footnote{Source: PARIS21 NSDS guidelines on data dissemination:
    \url{https://nsdsguidelines.paris21.org/node/796}} In order
  to ensure availability of minimum quality statistics on refugees and
  IDPs, it is recommended that national statistics providers include
  statistics on these priority indicators in the reporting plans for
  the 2030 Agenda. However, governments should not feel limited to
  this priority list, and data collection on additional indicators is
  encouraged.
\item
  A second initiative, the Expert Group meeting on Improving
  Migration Data in the Context of the 2030 Agenda,\footnote{\url{http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/stats/publications/2018/ECECESSTAT20182.pdf}
    - page 8.} has identified
  another 12 indicators which they recommend be disaggregated by
  migratory status. Both selected lists of SDG indicators are a useful
  resource for identifying indicators to measure the characteristics
  of IDPs within the criteria set forth by the IASC Framework.
\item
  Matching the collected data with the defined metrics and
  indicators, stocks and flows, can be done in various ways, depending
  on the data collection method used. Stock data can be populated
  based on questions asked within surveys and census, that aim to
  directly determine if and how many people match the selected
  characteristics for each type of stock (e.g.~a survey with a
  question such as ``have you been forced to leave your place of
  residence in the last x months/years?''), or using data obtained from
  registers of IDPs or refugees (see Phase 2).

\item
  From a legal perspective, durable solutions for refugees occur when
  refugees can once again enjoy the protection of a state, either
  through voluntary repatriation to their country of origin,
  integration in their host country, or resettlement to a third
  country. However, given the protracted nature of many conflicts,
  repatriation is not an immediate prospect for most refugees, and
  resettlement and naturalization are solutions for only a small
  minority. In reality, the majority of refugees aspire to, or enjoy,
  de facto integration in their host countries. Rather than a one-off
  event, the integration of refugees involves an incremental process.
  The IRRS focuses on the satisfaction of refugees' immediate and
  ongoing needs, their access to rights and on their integration.
  Living conditions can serve as a proxy for the satisfaction of these
  needs, and as data about peoples' living conditions have been
  routinely collected across the world for over 25 years, the results
  for the general population are already widely available. The
  satisfaction of basic needs, and the acquisition of rights is the
  first step in the integration of refugees.
\item
  Refugees have particular challenges compared to general migrants.
  Due to the forced nature of their migration and the traumatic
  experiences frequently associated with it, they often suffer from
  psychological distress and disabilities. Moreover, unlike labour
  migrants who tend to settle where their skills can be used more
  productively than in their home country, refugees may settle in
  areas with limited or no employment or other livelihood
  opportunities.
\item
  The IRRS presents recommendations for indicators that can be used
  to measure satisfaction of needs, access to rights and the
  integration of refugees with their host country or original country
  communities. The recommendations are grouped into three levels of
  indicators: priority, second level, and third level indicators.
  Table 5.1 of the IRRS presents the proposed indicators organized by
  the dimension of need and integration that it measures, specifically
  the following: (a) legal; (b) civil-political; (c) demographic and
  migration; (d) education; (e) economic; (f) social inclusion;
  and (g) health. In addition, several core classificatory variables
  are also recommended for the production of comparative analyses.
\item
  These classificatory variables are cross-referenced to those
  tabulations recommended earlier in Phase 2.1. These include country
  of birth, age, sex, reason for migrating, legal status, citizenship
  and length of time in the host country. Length of residence in the
  host country is especially important for statistics on integration
  because integration is a temporal process that begins when the
  refugee arrives in the host country. The pace of integration is
  usually different for refugee and refugee related groups compared
  with general migrants.
\item
  The characteristics of age and sex are used to disaggregate
  indicators of refugee living conditions and integration. For
  instance, using the sex variable to look at the difference in
  employment status between male and female refugees can highlight
  gender differences for that indicator. Classificatory variables are
  described in detail \emph{in} \emph{Table 2.9: Variables for refugee
  statistics}. As far as possible the proposed indicators correspond
  with those of the SDGs. Where they correspond, the equivalent SDG
  indicators have been noted in IRRS Table 5.1, the correspondence is
  often not direct. Guidance is given on the composition of the
  proposed indicators. Additionally, metadata for the SDG indicators
  are published by the United Nations Statistical Division on their
  website.\footnote{\url{https://nsdsguidelines.paris21.org/node/796}} The last column of Table 5.1 gives the closest SDG
  indicator equivalence, it is not proposed that all these indicators
  are used.
\item
  The Indicators of integration and the satisfaction of immediate and
  ongoing needs of refugees and refugee related populations are:

18. Civil-political indicators

  In 2015, an interagency process was established to operationalise
  the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) Framework. Under the
  leadership of the Mandate of the UN Special Rapporteur on the Human
  Rights of IDPs, a group of development, humanitarian and
  peacebuilding actors started work on developing and testing
  indicators and guidance for comprehensive durable solutions analysis
  in internal displacement situations and to measure progress over
  time. The work, coordinated by the Joint IDP Profiling Service,
  resulted in a library of standardised indicators and guidance for
  the operationalization of the eight IASC\footnote{Source:
    \url{https://paris21.org/sites/default/files/datapresentation_norway.pdf}
    - page 61.} criteria.
\item
  For a statistical approach for measuring progress towards durable
  solutions and whether key-displacement related vulnerabilities have
  been overcome. Two measures are proposed:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{verbatim}
24. The durable solutions progress measure designed to show the
    change in the share of IDPs who have overcome vulnerabilities
    linked to the criteria of the IASC Framework on Durable
    Solutions for IDPs over time. Therefore, this measure will be
    able to show whether progress is being made in overcoming the
    different vulnerabilities, and cumulatively, the progress made
    towards the achievement of durable solutions.

25. The composite measure designed to specify whether all key
    displacement-related vulnerabilities have been overcome and
    thus, whether or not persons with displacement-related
    protection needs and vulnerabilities can be taken out of the
    total IDP stock.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{436}
\item
  For the purpose of statistically measuring durable solutions
  progress, displacement-related vulnerabilities, sub-criteria were
  specified for each of the eight IASC criteria as is shown in Table
  6.3 Criteria and sub-criteria included in the composite measure
  (IRIS, Table 4.3) below. The first four criteria of the IASC
  Framework are relevant in all contexts and should therefore always
  be included. The last four should be considered and can be included
  if deemed relevant for the specific displacement context. Therefore,
  all eight criteria are included in recommendations to measure
  progress towards durable solutions (see IRIS, paragraph 146).
  Regarding the development of the composite measure for overcoming
  key displacement-related vulnerabilities, a smaller set of criteria
  are chosen, including the four deemed to always be relevant in
  displacement contexts. Given the prevalence of challenges linked to
  lack of documentation in many displacement settings, it is also
  recommended to include the fifth criteria on access to personal and
  other documentation in any statistical measure that can result in
  taking IDPs out of the stock. This measure therefore prioritises
  five of the eight criteria (see IRIS, paragraph 164).
\item
  For each sub-criterion, there are many different indicators which
  can be chosen, although a final list has not yet been agreed. The
  indicators selected in each national context should, as far as
  possible, be aligned with already tested and standardized
  indicators. The Durable Solutions indicator library provides a
  thorough overview of potential options (see Durable Solutions
  Library\footnote{Source:
    \url{https://www.ssb.no/en/omssb/samarbeid/internasjonalt-utviklingssamarbeid/_attachment/117795?_ts=13f15ca60c0}
    page 50.}). Where relevant, they should also mirror the SDG
  indicators recommended to be disaggregated by different categories
  of displacement. Indicators selected should be carefully chosen to
  ensure they are relevant for all three sub-stocks of the displaced
  population: IDPs in locations of displacement, IDPs in locations of
  return and IDPs in other settlement locations.
\item
  A preliminary proposal of indicators for the sub-criteria has been
  developed by the EGRIS' IDP subgroup (see IRIS for discussion of
  indicator selection), taking into consideration the above listed
  aspects. The aim of this work was to provide a short, manageable
  list of one or two indicators per sub-criteria. However, given the
  limited availability of data, particularly for the sub-criteria
  which experts determined to be displacement-specific, it is too
  preliminary to recommend a final list of indicators for each
  sub-criterion at this stage. Further testing is required to detail
  out this proposal. As this work progresses, information will be
  added to future editions of the Compilers' Manual, including
  implications for target setting based on different types of
  indicators (see IRIS, paragraph 166). Once finalized an updated
  version of these Recommendations could be considered. In the
  meantime, countries and international organisations should use the
  durable solutions indicator library as a reference and starting
  point for indicator selection and should as far as possible follow
  principles described (see IRIS, paragraphs 135-137).

  The Government of Sudan and the international community are working
  together to jointly support durable solutions for Darfur's
  internally displaced people. The commitment is rooted in the Doha
  Document for Peace in Darfur (DDPD) from 2011, signed by the
  Government of Sudan, other major parties to the conflict and the
  international community, and which sets out the framework for peace
  in Darfur.
\item
  A durable solutions process was piloted in El Fasher in North
  Darfur. To reach durable solutions and end displacement, long-term
  planning based on agreed and jointly-owned comprehensive data is
  needed. To establish an agreed evidence base, a collaborative
  profiling approach was adopted that brought actors together to
  ensure trust and ownership of the results of the profiling exercise.
  An important aspect of this durable solutions profiling is that it
  places IDPs centre-stage alongside the two other major
  stakeholders---the Government of Sudan and the international
  community---permitting the profiling results and recommendations to
  be owned and signed off by all parties.
\item
  The durable solutions profiling exercise in El Fasher specifically
  aims to:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{verbatim}
28. Provide a comprehensive profile of IDPs residing in Abu Shouk
    and El Salaam IDP camps.

29. Develop a better understanding of IDPs' vulnerabilities, coping
    mechanisms, capacities and provide insight into IDPs'
    perceptions and their future settlement intentions.

30. Provide a jointly agreed upon data set to help inform durable
    solutions programming responses.

31. Pilot a profiling exercise of displacement and joint durable
    solutions planning that could be replicated in other Sudan
    contexts with displaced populations.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{enumerate}

\setcounter{enumi}{446}
\item
  The profiling exercise adopted the Inter-Agency Standing Committee
  (IASC) Framework on Durable Solutions for Internally Displaced
  Persons as an analytical framework. The profiling was designed to
  take into account the displaced persons' perspectives on durable
  solutions including preferred settlement options and places a strong
  emphasis on understanding the rationale behind these preferences. It
  is also concerned with understanding the progress IDP communities
  have made across the IASC durable solutions criteria and applied an
  area-based comparative approach.
\item
  This comparative analysis was used to understand whether hardships
  are a result of IDPs' displacement or development challenges shared
  with non-displaced communities in El Fasher. Finally, it included a
  macrolevel urban analysis. The profiling exercise used mixed
  methods: mapping and enumeration, a household survey, and key
  informant interviews. The profiling applied a gender lens and
  questions for further analysis, which were included in the report
  narrative when significant gender related differences were
  identified. The repost gives details of the indicators used as part

\setcounter{enumi}{459}
\item
  This sub-process is where statisticians validate the quality of the
  outputs produced, in accordance with a general quality framework
  (developed in Phase 2) and with expectations based on local
  knowledge. This sub-process also includes activities involved with
  the gathering of intelligence, with the cumulative effect of
  building up a body of knowledge about a specific statistical domain.
  This knowledge is then applied to the current collection, in the
  current environment, to identify any divergence from expectations
  and to allow informed analyses. Validation activities can include
  checking the population coverage in the sample group and looking for
  content errors.
\item
  An example is Population Census coverage that can involve two or
  three major problems such as under representation, over
  representation, and selection bias in the study design. The most
  common problem is under-representation of the population in the
  sample group or due to selection bias in the research design.
  Generally, an aggregate undercount of 3 to 6\% is considered
  acceptable, but some population groups tend to be disproportionately
  affected, e.g.~very young children, young mobile men and
  undocumented migrants. Over-coverage also happens, especially if
  local authorities, with an interest in exaggerating their
  populations, are able to influence the data collection.
\item
  Content errors might involve non-response bias and response bias
  for some of the key variables in the data collection phase.
  Individual data are often provided by an informant who is either the
  head of household or another responsible adult household member.
  These proxy respondents may not know all the details regarding each
  member of the households, or sometimes may not want to share the
  facts. The household members themselves may be unsure or
  misunderstand the question. They may even hide or distort
  information on purpose (see also under-reporting of
  consumption\footnote{\url{https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/10186/9268011/IMPARTIAL_ACCESS_2014_JAN-EN.PDF.pdf}}. As a result, data quality may be poor, despite
  excellent coverage. Therefore, it is necessary to detect those
  errors in the in the analysis phase and select the right analysis
  techniques to eradicate or minimise the content error.
\item
  There are several methods for quality assessment. Content errors
  can often be detected through internal consistency analysis by
  crosschecking the data across different datasets. Furthermore, the
  analyst can resort to the following mechanisms to validate the
  findings:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Comparing the statistics with previous cycles (if applicable and
  \textgreater{} available),
\item
  Checking that the associated metadata and paradata (process
  \textgreater{} metadata) are present and in line with the expectations,
\item
  Checking the statistics for consistency against other relevant data
  \textgreater{} (both internal and external), comparing with other national
  \textgreater{} sources, operational and global data,
\item
  Investigating inconsistencies in the statistics,
\item
  Agreeing with the accepted threshold level in applying the quality
  \textgreater{} standards and validation processes
\item
  Performing macro editing, and
\item
  Validating the statistics against expectations and domain
  \textgreater{} intelligence.
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}

\item
  The main criteria are: is the data understandable, usable for
  analysis and fit for purpose, particularly the purpose that was
  articulated in the Design phase. Does it respond to the questions
  that were set initially?
\item
  Comparators are important, either from another dataset relating to
  a similar group or population, or to the same group/population
  across different time periods. Particularly important is coherence
  when comparing datasets are those obtained via different methods
  (e.g.~surveys versus registration). Although the figures obtained
  via different methods will not always match, they need to show clear
  relative trends, to allow comparability. The availability of good
  metadata for both datasets will enable judgments to be made about
  the reasons for differences and for a judgement to be made about the
  quality of the data.
\item
  The \textbf{\emph{analytical framework}} should include \textbf{\emph{commentary and
  notes}}, to allow proper understanding of how the data was obtained
  and treated, in order to support the accessibility and credibility
  of the results. This commentary should be accompanied by clear
  explanatory metadata pertaining to how the data were collected,
  processed and analysed (see Phase 7 on metadata)
\item
  Complement the estimates with \textbf{\emph{contextual updates}}, to inform
  the reader and to allow for better understanding of trends. If
  numbers go up, does this correspond to greater coverage, or to an
  increase in violence, attacks or incidence of disasters. Try to
  explain what the likely correlates are.
\item
  \textbf{\emph{Triangulation}}: use operational data for comparison,
  particularly for flow data, as operational data is more likely to
  capture micro-movements, spontaneous movements, short-term
  displacements. It is necessary to make sure the trends match between
  the various datasets without any major deviation. If the variation
  between two stocks is not significant, but operational data
  identifies a high number of smaller, shorter term movements (e.g.~in
  the case of preventative evacuations leading to quick returns, or
  mass movements leading to cross border returns), then this should
  allow official statistics to verify/correct their flow data.
\item
  Linking to cross border data, \textbf{\emph{interoperability}}: if movements
  lead to significant cross-border flight or returns, the datasets on
  both sides of the border should correspond with each other to ensure
  validity. Refugee data could be compared to third country nationals,
  refugees, migrants in other countries, to validate estimates and
  trends. Example: the stocks of IDPs in South Sudan only increase
  marginally between two data collection periods; however, the number
  of South Sudanese nationals in the Central African Republic increase
  exponentially, then the likelihood is that people were displaced
  over the border. Operational flow data from displacement event
  should reflect that significant variation, even if the stocks do
  not.
\item
  Even if variations in operational flow data from incidents do not
  match variations in stocks, the differences between the different
  stock types should be proportional. However, an increase in the
  number of displacements does not mean that a similar same increase
  will appear in stocks, as those displacements could relate to the
  same people being displaced on multiple occasions. For example, if
  the numbers of IDPs in an area decreases, the numbers corresponding
  to that decrease should be reflected in another stock, e.g.~there
  are 10,000 less IDPs in Borno State in Nigeria, because there are
  10,000 more Nigerian refugees in Cameroon.

  This sub-process calls upon the in-depth expertise of statisticians
  to understand, interpret and explain the statistics produced by
  assessing how well the findings reflect their initial expectations.
  This involves viewing the statistics from all perspectives using
  different tools and media, and also carrying out in-depth
  statistical analyses.
\item
  The analyst should check to see if the data respond to the question
  that were initially set and do the outputs match what was determined
  in the Design phase? A basic analysis might ask the following
  questions:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{verbatim}
36. What are the variations from one reporting period to another?

37. Are those variations attributed to contextual or methodological
    considerations or both? (i.e. more to do with displacement
    trends or to do with the data collection and treatment methods)

38. Are the variations consistent across the entire context in scope
    of the analysis? Are there different trends within that scope?
    How can these be explained?

39. How are stocks and flows affected by the changes? Has one
    indicator changed more than others, i.e. have flows
    increased/decreased significantly whereas stocks have changed
    more marginally?

40. Which flows have changed the most, and what does this tell us?
    E.g. has the number of IDPs increased/decreased much more in
    comparison with cross-border flight and refugee numbers abroad?

41. Have methodologies changed? If so, why? How does this impact the
    accuracy and comparability of the analysis?

42. Do the variations in numbers correspond to contextual changes
    that can explain them?

43. Which groups, as highlighted by the sex and age disaggregated
    data (SADD) and other forms of disaggregation, are the most
    impacted? Why? Has that changed since the last reporting period?

44. Do the official statistics vary significantly in relation to
    other datasets produced by other sources, particularly
    operational actors? If so, why?

45. Do the variations correlate with specific actions taken to
    prevent or solve situations of displacement/provision of
    assistance/interventions/any form of state operation?

  ``The State of Humanitarian Shelter and Settlements'' report by
  Global Shelter Cluster (GSC) report provided an in-depth review of
  the evidence base of the shelter and settlements sector, and the
  sector's data collection practices. One of the main difficulties
  encountered when attempting to measure shelter adequacy is obtaining
  accurate data across various contexts. This is due partly to the
  multi-sectoral nature of the criteria, and the wide range of
  environments in which humanitarian agencies work, as well as to
  variations between shelter designs, materials and costs. In
  addition, different adequacy indicators may sometimes conflict with
  each other. Most shelter actors therefore agree that a
  one-size-fits-all definition of adequacy is almost impossible.
\item
  To compare and analyse the data, GSC created a sub-set of
  information in order to gather data for disasters, conflicts and
  crises between 2013 and 2018 for which a Shelter Cluster (SC)
  response or SC-like response had been activated. The methodology is
  explained in detail in Part 3 of this report

  At the Design phase, the outputs should be designed with a clear
  understanding of the required information needed from those outputs
  to respond to the agreed questions. This should dictate how much
  information is necessary to collect, and what falls outside of that
  scope.
\item
  Due consideration should be given to privacy in accordance with
  national and international law, and to any type of information that
  could lead to the respondents being identified or suffering from
  discrimination as a result of their participation or responses in a
  survey/census should not be disclosed.
\item
  Disclosure should also include considerations of interoperability:
  how datasets on different population types talk to each other, their
  ability to share information on those populations, or even on
  specific individuals, their characteristics and their needs. This
  can enable possibilities for combining datasets to improve coverage
  and quality (see section on \emph{Data Source D: Integrated Data}). This
  can also help prevent duplication of data. A data protection policy
  should be in place from the start, and Phase 2D discusses the \emph{a.
  Legal environment and data protection legislation} and the other
  capacity requirements for this.
\item
  Data integration may be possible where the data being collected by
  various government databases relates to individuals, groups or
  populations who are registered in one or more government databases.
  Inter-agency data sharing protocols can enable this and also help to
  prevent duplication. As the various service needs of the concerned
  populations are likely to be addressed by different entities within
  the government (or even by entities outside of it), data sharing
  between those entities will ensure greater capacity for analysis.
\item
  There are technical computer languages that allow data sharing more
  effectively, such as tagging, e.g.~using HXL, allowing the data
  outputs to be identifiable by various data sharing platforms, and
  for the various elements of the datasets to be identified and shared
  individually as well.

  It is crucial to account for any caveats/limitations that may

  geographical coverage of the datasets. This should include coverage
  problems which have resulted from difficulty of access in particular
  locations. All caveats must be detailed: specific to each collection

  Dissemination is a phase in the statistical process, in which the
  data collected, and outputs compiled by national statistical offices
  (NSOs) and other relevant national authorities are released to the
  public. It features as a step in the GSBPM
\item
  The responsibility for disseminating refugee and IDPs statistics
  varies from country to country and the dissemination practices
  differ significantly in their methods and effectiveness. In many
  countries, immigration authorities or other government ministries,
  departments or agencies (e.g.~Ministry of Interiors) provide the NSO
  and UNHCR with the relevant data for compilation, validation and
  analysis. After validation, the NSO and/or relevant authorities
  disseminate the statistics, sometimes in parallel. In other
  countries, refugee data are collected directly by UNHCR, who also
  disseminate them.\footnote{Source IRRS:
    \url{https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/3859598/9315869/KS-GQ-18-004-EN-N.pdf/d331c9cc-1091-43c2-b589-2c250bccc281}
    - page 125.} A more harmonized approach is needed to the
  dissemination of refugee and IDP statistics.
\item
  The phase is composed of five sub-processes, that are briefly
  described below. Then on the subsequent pages, each section is
  discussed at length. The sub-process sections include general advice
  and specific examples of refugee and IDPs applications. The 5
  sub-processes are:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{verbatim}
**7.1 Update of output systems**[^3]
\end{verbatim}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{488}
\tightlist
\item
  This sub-process manages the update of an existing system where
  data and metadata are stored ready for dissemination purposes,
  including: a) formatting data and metadata ready to be put into
  output systems; b) loading data and metadata into output systems; c)
  ensuring data are linked to the relevant metadata.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{verbatim}
**7.2 Production of dissemination products**
\end{verbatim}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{489}
\tightlist
\item
  This sub-process describes the various forms available for
  dissemination products, including: a) online data (e.g.~databases
  with predefined datasets presenting aggregated data), b) analytical
  publications/reports, c) user-friendly leaflets, booklets, flyers,
  posters; d) digital publications; and e) public-use micro-data sets
  and downloadable files. This section of the Manual also provides
  examples of publication guidelines to facilitate the production
  process.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{verbatim}
**7.3 Management of the release of products**
\end{verbatim}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{490}
\item
  As highlighted in the IRRS and IRIS documents, dissemination
  "should be guided by a number of principles including those
  established in the \emph{Fundamental Principles of Official
  Statistics}\footnote{\url{https://unstats.un.org/unsd/dnss/gp/fundprinciples.aspx}}, such as objectivity, impartiality, confidentiality,
  privacy, timeliness and accessibility".
\item
  This section discusses the characteristics of an effective data
  dissemination system. It aims to ensure that all the elements for
  the statistical release are in place, including managing the timing
  of the release, briefings for specific groups such as the press, as
  well as the arrangements for any pre-release embargoes. It also
  covers the provision of products to subscribers and managing access
  to confidential data by authorised user groups, such as researchers
  and the error correction and notification policy.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{verbatim}
**7.4 Promotion of dissemination products**
\end{verbatim}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{492}
\tightlist
\item
  This sub-process includes the activities that are naturally
  associated with the data dissemination such as data publishing, and
  also activities related to the promotion of the dissemination
  products. This active promotion of the statistical products helps to
  reach the widest possible audience. It includes the use of different
  communication tools to facilitate the sharing of statistical
  information to users.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{verbatim}
**7.5 Management of user support**
\end{verbatim}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{493}
\tightlist
\item
  This sub-process explains how the dissemination of statistical
  products requires proper management of the user support. User
  queries and requests for other services such as microdata access
  should be recorded, and responses to these requests should be
  provided within agreed deadlines. These queries and requests should
  be regularly reviewed to provide an input to the overarching quality
  management process, as they can indicate new or changing user needs.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{update-output-systems}{%
\subsection{Update output systems}\label{update-output-systems}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{494}
\tightlist
\item
  As formatting, loading and linking of metadata should take place in
  earlier phases, this sub-process focuses on final checks that all of
  the necessary elements are in place ready for dissemination.
  Therefore, this upload of the data and metadata should pay attention
  to the following principles:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{verbatim}
1.  ***Manual or automated update process***: in order to streamline
    the update, it is advisable to automate this process. The update
    process should be defined in the design phase and executed as
    well as governed in this phase.

2.  **Checking Technical requirements of the update:** Technical
    requirements for data exchange between systems like application
    programming interface (API), data exchange format (like SDMX),
    authentication/access rights and control, etc. should be defined
    in the design phase, and implemented and tested in the Build
    phase. Checking takes place in this sub-process to avoid
    potential errors, and prevent delays in the update of the output
    system.

3.  ***Monitoring of the upload process and verification of its
    correctness:*** If the update is done automatically, it is
    important to control and verify the results of this process
    (e.g. check for errors in the data, metadata, proper layout,
    descriptions). Therefore, it is necessary to assign this
    responsibility to a person who works with the selected output
    system.

4.  **Detection and diagnostics of potential loading issues
    (consistency of data, no loading errors etc.):** As the
    electronic transfer might face interruptions, it is important to
    control this process and also to perform manual checks. As
    above, this checking should be assigned to a responsible person.

5.  **Ensure Security:** In order to ensure the secure transfer of
    data between different systems, security rules should be
    established. The application of the rules can come from the
    output system 'owner' or sender to the recipient output
    system/database. In all cases, the minimum security settings
    should be defined, e.g. transfer of the data from the source to
    the destination system, output database should be encrypted and
    protected, and the security "health checks" should be part of
    the monitoring process.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{495}
\item
  As highlighted in the IRRS document, it is important to use a
  single portal/platform and single access point for disseminating all
  national refugee and IDP statistics. This approach can minimise
  confusion for users who consult various non-integrated portals often
  with conflicting results.
\item
  The decision on whether to use an existing dissemination hub or to
  develop a new one should be taken by national/regional or
  international statistical agencies while developing dissemination
  tools. However, it is recommended that statistical agencies take
  expert advice and access available information before choosing the
  system that best meets their dissemination needs.

\item
  As part of its Africa Information Highway (AIH), the African
  Development Bank (AfDB) provides an Open Data Platform (ODP) to all
  African countries. The key role of these portals is to facilitate
  statistical data access across Africa.
\item
  The ODP integrates many functionalities that allows countries to:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{verbatim}
6.  ***Upload and update databases on the system, ***

7.  ***Create dynamic dashboards based on uploaded data,***

\end{verbatim}

\begin{enumerate}

  The portal also gives countries the opportunity to integrate data
  from NSOs and line ministries within the NSS. In the context of
  refugees and IDPs, the ODP could play a key role in facilitating
  access to this data in African countries already using the platform
  for their dissemination. This is already done for SDG data and
  macro-economic data, the refugees and IDP data could be easily
  integrated to the African countries' ODP.
\item
  Recently, African countries have populated SDG hubs, having
  installed them as part of the ODP and also developed `National
  Summary Data Pages'. In this respect, a module could easily be added
  to the platform for disseminating refugees and IDP data.

  \emph{This paper offers lessons on how the deployment, design and
  technology considerations can be improved as NSOs enter the
  implementation and monitoring phase of the SDGs -- which will lead
  to a further push for data portals. The paper finds that while there
  have been many good intentions to make these portals available to
  countries, when it comes to actual implementation the outcomes are
  rather mixed. One particular problem is the set-up of multiple data
  portals with overlapping functionalities and their lack of
  integration -- particularly in the most aid-dependent countries.
  This results in (i) a duplication of workload for already
  resource-constrained NSOs who have to maintain several portals and
  update information manually, (ii) confusion for users who consult
  the various portals with often conflicting results, and (iii)
  overall high costs for demonstrably low usage of these portals.}

  The following Dissemination products are among the most widely
  used:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Datasets} - multi-dimensional tables used to store the base data
  \textgreater{} and more appropriate for use by statistical and other experts via
  \textgreater{} special applications. For dissemination purposes the data
  \textgreater{} presented in the datasets should be aggregated to a level that is
  \textgreater{} safe to share and accompanied by relevant metadata.
\item
  \textbf{Predefined tables} - used to provide easy access to the main
  \textgreater{} statistical indicators. They are generally based on datasets and
  \textgreater{} are derived from them. They are predefined, non-modifiable and
  \textgreater{} present a limited number of dimensions.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Statistics explained articles} - contain statistical data and
  \textgreater{} explanations, but also direct links to all kinds of relevant
  \textgreater{} background information which may be useful to understand the
  \textgreater{} statistics.
\item
  User-friendly \textbf{leaflets, booklets, flyers, posters.}
\item
  \textbf{Statistical reports -} presenting a selection of data on specific
  \textgreater{} topics, including descriptive statistics that provide a general
  \textgreater{} picture of the findings.
\item
  \textbf{Digital publications} -- composed of short texts, dynamic
  \textgreater{} infographics, maps, videos, graphs, photos, etc.
\item
  \textbf{Visualisations}, including \textbf{maps and infographs} -
  \textgreater{} visualisation tools, which are easily understandable, interactive
  \textgreater{} and storytelling.
\item
  \textbf{Public-use micro-data sets and downloadable files} -- that
  \textgreater{} consist of sets of records containing information on individuals,
  \textgreater{} households or business entities. The files are created to allow
  \textgreater{} the general public to become familiar with statistical microdata.
  \textgreater{} The files are prepared in such a way that individual entities
  \textgreater{} cannot be identified, but with a consequent loss in information
  \textgreater{} value.

  Finally, the sections of the report should be presented and the main
  findings or most relevant figures/charts.
\item
  \textbf{Glossary}: if needed, it is recommended to include a glossary
  defining key terms in the beginning of the document.
\item
  \textbf{List of figures.}
\item
  \textbf{Suggested content sections:}

  \textbf{Demographics chapter}: providing the snapshot information of
  observed population groups based on sex-age and geographic
  disaggregation, household size; if available and applicable
  comparing changes with previous periods, also in terms of
  demographic balance (births and deaths). If available highlight
  vulnerable population (children and youth, women in vulnerability,
  disability, dismembered households).

  \textbf{Sectoral /living conditions chapters} (e.g.~Housing, Education,
  Health, Employment): detailing the current living conditions of the
  observed population.

  \textbf{Mobility chapter}: focusing on the subset of the population that
  has moved in the last 12 months. It should outline places of origin
  and destination, habitual and current residence, as well as current
  displacement status (IDP, refugee or neither), and previous status
  if available.

  The production of dissemination products must be adapted to the
  different users and their needs, particularly in the volume and
  detail of information required. Thus, there might be a need to have
  different user segments (as proposed below by the Task Force on
  Value of Official Statistics).\footnote{\url{http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/stats/publications/2018/ECECESSTAT20182.pdf}
    - page 8.} Such segmentation can serve as a
  basis for constructing well-based production and communication of
  statistics. These user groups include:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{verbatim}
A. Users with a general interest

-   Citizens

-   Media and journalists

-   Students and teachers

    B. Users with a pre-defined/structured interest

  This sub-process should ensure that all elements for the release
  are in place. It includes managing the timing of the release,
  briefings for specific groups such as the press, as well as the

  confidential data by authorised user groups, such as researchers and
  the error correction and notification policy.
\item
  Dissemination of statistical data to the wider public follows
  several dissemination principles set by dissemination polices. The
  management of the release of dissemination products requires careful
  planning and execution of the following aspects:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{verbatim}
19. **Data release** -- the statistical organization must ensure
    that all users have equitable and timely access to data that are
    disseminated to the public; there must be a clear guide for the
    users where they can find the data (on the respective
    portal/website and via different mobile apps),

20. **Time of release and data extraction** -- the database should
    always contain the latest version of data; there should be
    regular intervals for the data\' updates; the statistical
    organization should minimize the interval between the period to
    which the data refer and the date when the product is released
    to the public; in case of revisions to the data after an initial
    release, the users must be notified about these changes in an
    equitable and timely manner; whenever preliminary data are
    released, they must be identified as preliminary; the ways that
    users can extract the data should be clearly explained (e.g.
    directly from the database or via \'bulk download\' facility),

    For example: Eurostat dissemination policy for Asylum statistics
    stares that updates are done twice a week on Tuesday and
    Thursday, at 11:00 am

21. **Release calendar** should be available in advance of
    publication, e.g. prior to the beginning of the calendar year
    the statistical organization shall provide the users with a
    schedule of when statistical products are expected to be
    released during the upcoming year; such a calendar should be
    available on the portal/website and revised in a timely manner.

    Equal treatment (all media should have access to releases of the
    new statistics at the same time),
  \item
    Release calendar (all media should be informed about coming
    releases in advance in order to have some time for
    planning/research)
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  \textbf{Pre-release access/release of the statistical results under
  embargo} -- this is the privileged pre-release access that should
  be limited, controlled and publicised; such access should be well
  described and published by the statistical organisation; the
  respective document should set out how the organisation fulfils its
  responsibilities in this respect and gives details of the conditions
  of pre-release access.

\textbf{Managing access to confidential data by authorised user
groups}\footnote{Source:

  - page 6.}

The sixth United Nations Fundamental Principle of Official Statistics
is very clear on statistical confidentiality. Any principles for
microdata access must be consistent with this Fundamental Principle.

``Individual data collected by statistical agencies for statistical
compilation, whether or not they refer to natural or legal persons,
are to be strictly confidential and used exclusively for statistical
purposes.''

The following principles should be used for managing the
confidentiality of microdata:

Principle 1: It is appropriate for microdata collected for official
statistical purposes to be used for statistical analysis to support
research as long as confidentiality is protected.

Principle 2: Microdata should only be made available for statistical
purposes.

Principle 3: Provision of microdata should be consistent with legal
and other necessary arrangements that ensure that confidentiality of
the released microdata is protected.

Principle 4: The procedures for researcher access to microdata, as
well as the uses and users of microdata, should be transparent and
publicly available.

  Dissemination consists not only of the activities that are assumed
  with the data dissemination such as data publishing, but also
  activities related to the promotion of the dissemination products.
  Thus, this sub-process focusses on active promotion of the
  statistical products to help them reach the widest possible
  audience. It includes the use of different communication tools to
  reach the biggest audience and best facilitate the process of
  sharing statistical information with users:

\item
  Conferences, public debates and fairs are still very useful and
  powerful channels of communication as the target audience (i.e.
  users interested in a specific topic) is present in one place.
  Through panels with speakers, meetings with subject matter experts,
  distribution of promotion materials, the users have a unique
  opportunity to acquire up-to-date information.

  Social media can be a very useful tool in the dissemination and
  discussion of official statistics, as it offers tailor-made
  solutions to reaching individuals interested in official data. They
  are mainly used to distribute information, to promote the use of
  statistics and to increase statistical literacy. They can also be
  used to reach new audiences and to improve user support, as well as
  to receive user feedback and for marketing purposes.

27. **Collaborative projects***,* **e.g. Wikipedia,** serve as an
    online database, allowing users to pool knowledge and
    information on particular topics to be viewed by other
    interested parties.

28. **Blogs and microblogs, e.g. WordPress or Twitter**, are a type
    of website or part of a website maintained by an individual with
    regular entries of commentary, graphics or video. Many blogs
    provide commentary or news on a particular subject; others
    function as more personal online diaries.

29. **Content communities, e.g. YouTube or Flickr, Delicious,**
    where users can upload, share, and view multimedia content such
    as videos, pictures, music or presentations.

30. **Social networking sites, e.g. Facebook or LinkedIn,** are
    online services, platforms or sites that focus on building and
    reflecting social networks or social relations among people who
    share interests or activities.

\begin{enumerate}

\setcounter{enumi}{530}
\item
  This sub-process ensures that user queries and requests for
  services such as microdata access are recorded, and that responses
  are provided within agreed deadlines. These queries and requests
  should be regularly reviewed to provide an input to the overarching
  quality management process, as they can indicate new or changing
  user needs.
\item
  Replies to user requests can also be used to populate a knowledge
  database or a ``Frequently Asked Questions'' page that is made
  publicly available, thus reducing the burden of replying to repeated
  and/or similar requests from external users.
\item
  User support provides assistance to all types of users: newcomers,
  sporadic visitors, more experienced users, journalists. For those
  who are visiting the portal/website for the first time a short
  'first-time help' video can be offered, while for all users there
  are replies to frequently asked questions. Additionally, the
  statistical agency can propose more personal user support for those
  who would like to submit questions in their national language.
\item
  If data are not available from the portal/website at the level of
  detail or in the format or layout the user requires, the respective
  user support service may be able to provide customised data to meet
  the user's specific requirements, e.g.~tabulations not readily
  available from Eurostat's online database can be requested via
  their user support service.
\item
  In some NSOs, statistics on refugees and IDPs may be a new product
  for those responsible for user support so staff may need additional
  training on dealing with the topic, particularly as it may be
  perceived as controversial.
\item
  Elements to be considered while establishing the user support
  service:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{verbatim}
i.  Providing assistance to all types of users: newcomers, sporadic
    visitors or more experienced users. Example: Eurostat providing
    training to different policy Directorates-General of the
    European Commission on Asylum and managed migration statistics

ii. Creation of the first-visit tutorial -- for those who are
    visiting the website for the first time, Example:
    <https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/help/first-visit>

iii. Creation of the section dedicated to replies to frequently
    asked questions, Example:
    <https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/help/faq>

iv. Creation of the press centre for the use of journalists and
    fact-checkers, Example:
    <https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/help/press-media-support>

v.  Creation of the multilingual user support giving the possibility
    to submit the questions in several languages (optionally, where
    relevant), Example:
    <https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/help/support>;
\end{verbatim}

Investigating new innovative solutions for user support -- e.g.
developing a Live Chat (real time conversations) Virtual Assistant tool
with users, Example: \url{https://www.stat.ee/news-release-2019-042}
