Dissemination
=============

> "This phase manages the release of the statistical products to
> customers. It includes all activities associated with assembling and
> releasing a range of static and dynamic products via a range of
> channels. These activities support customers to access and use the
> outputs released by the statistical organisation[^1]." (UNECE, 2013)

486. Dissemination is a phase in the statistical process, in which the
    data collected, and outputs compiled by national statistical offices
    (NSOs) and other relevant national authorities are released to the
    public. It features as a step in the GSBPM

487. The responsibility for disseminating refugee and IDPs statistics
    varies from country to country and the dissemination practices
    differ significantly in their methods and effectiveness. In many
    countries, immigration authorities or other government ministries,
    departments or agencies (e.g. Ministry of Interiors) provide the NSO
    and UNHCR with the relevant data for compilation, validation and
    analysis. After validation, the NSO and/or relevant authorities
    disseminate the statistics, sometimes in parallel. In other
    countries, refugee data are collected directly by UNHCR, who also
    disseminate them.[^2] A more harmonized approach is needed to the
    dissemination of refugee and IDP statistics.

488. The phase is composed of five sub-processes, that are briefly
    described below. Then on the subsequent pages, each section is
    discussed at length. The sub-process sections include general advice
    and specific examples of refugee and IDPs applications. The 5
    sub-processes are:

    **7.1 Update of output systems**[^3]

489. This sub-process manages the update of an existing system where
    data and metadata are stored ready for dissemination purposes,
    including: a) formatting data and metadata ready to be put into
    output systems; b) loading data and metadata into output systems; c)
    ensuring data are linked to the relevant metadata.

    **7.2 Production of dissemination products**

490. This sub-process describes the various forms available for
    dissemination products, including: a) online data (e.g. databases
    with predefined datasets presenting aggregated data), b) analytical
    publications/reports, c) user-friendly leaflets, booklets, flyers,
    posters; d) digital publications; and e) public-use micro-data sets
    and downloadable files. This section of the Manual also provides
    examples of publication guidelines to facilitate the production
    process.

    **7.3 Management of the release of products**

491. As highlighted in the IRRS and IRIS documents, dissemination
    \"should be guided by a number of principles including those
    established in the *Fundamental Principles of Official
    Statistics*[^4], such as objectivity, impartiality, confidentiality,
    privacy, timeliness and accessibility\".

492. This section discusses the characteristics of an effective data
    dissemination system. It aims to ensure that all the elements for
    the statistical release are in place, including managing the timing
    of the release, briefings for specific groups such as the press, as
    well as the arrangements for any pre-release embargoes. It also
    covers the provision of products to subscribers and managing access
    to confidential data by authorised user groups, such as researchers
    and the error correction and notification policy.

    **7.4 Promotion of dissemination products**

493. This sub-process includes the activities that are naturally
    associated with the data dissemination such as data publishing, and
    also activities related to the promotion of the dissemination
    products. This active promotion of the statistical products helps to
    reach the widest possible audience. It includes the use of different
    communication tools to facilitate the sharing of statistical
    information to users.

    **7.5 Management of user support**

494. This sub-process explains how the dissemination of statistical
    products requires proper management of the user support. User
    queries and requests for other services such as microdata access
    should be recorded, and responses to these requests should be
    provided within agreed deadlines. These queries and requests should
    be regularly reviewed to provide an input to the overarching quality
    management process, as they can indicate new or changing user needs.

Update output systems
--------------------------

495. As formatting, loading and linking of metadata should take place in
    earlier phases, this sub-process focuses on final checks that all of
    the necessary elements are in place ready for dissemination.
    Therefore, this upload of the data and metadata should pay attention
    to the following principles:

    1.  ***Manual or automated update process***: in order to streamline
        the update, it is advisable to automate this process. The update
        process should be defined in the design phase and executed as
        well as governed in this phase.

    2.  **Checking Technical requirements of the update:** Technical
        requirements for data exchange between systems like application
        programming interface (API), data exchange format (like SDMX),
        authentication/access rights and control, etc. should be defined
        in the design phase, and implemented and tested in the Build
        phase. Checking takes place in this sub-process to avoid
        potential errors, and prevent delays in the update of the output
        system.

    3.  ***Monitoring of the upload process and verification of its
        correctness:*** If the update is done automatically, it is
        important to control and verify the results of this process
        (e.g. check for errors in the data, metadata, proper layout,
        descriptions). Therefore, it is necessary to assign this
        responsibility to a person who works with the selected output
        system.

    4.  **Detection and diagnostics of potential loading issues
        (consistency of data, no loading errors etc.):** As the
        electronic transfer might face interruptions, it is important to
        control this process and also to perform manual checks. As
        above, this checking should be assigned to a responsible person.

    5.  **Ensure Security:** In order to ensure the secure transfer of
        data between different systems, security rules should be
        established. The application of the rules can come from the
        output system 'owner' or sender to the recipient output
        system/database. In all cases, the minimum security settings
        should be defined, e.g. transfer of the data from the source to
        the destination system, output database should be encrypted and
        protected, and the security "health checks" should be part of
        the monitoring process.

496. As highlighted in the IRRS document, it is important to use a
    single portal/platform and single access point for disseminating all
    national refugee and IDP statistics. This approach can minimise
    confusion for users who consult various non-integrated portals often
    with conflicting results.

497. The decision on whether to use an existing dissemination hub or to
    develop a new one should be taken by national/regional or
    international statistical agencies while developing dissemination
    tools. However, it is recommended that statistical agencies take
    expert advice and access available information before choosing the
    system that best meets their dissemination needs.

### Existing output systems (portals and platforms) {#existing-output-systems-portals-and-platforms .ListParagraph}

#### Example 7.1 Eurostat Census Hub:

498. The Census Hub is an easy-to-use tool that allows users to access
    census data. It can quickly produce customised tabulations; users
    specify the tables that they need, and the tool extracts the
    necessary data from the databases held by the NSOs. Data from the
    national databases are then compiled by the Census Hub, with output
    either displayed on screen or in spreadsheet-readable files.

[**https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/population-and-housing-census/census-data/2011-census**](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/population-and-housing-census/census-data/2011-census)

#### Example 7.2 **CROS Portal** (Portal on Collaboration in Research and Methodology for Official Statistics:

499. The CROS Portal is dedicated to the collaboration between
    researchers and Official Statisticians in Europe and beyond. It
    provides a working space and tools for dissemination and information
    exchange for statistical projects and methodological topics. The
    services provided include hosting of statistical communities,
    repositories of useful documents, research results, project
    deliverables, and discussion fora.

Link:
[**https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cros/**](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cros/)

#### Example 7.3 African Development Bank's Open Data Platform: 

500. As part of its Africa Information Highway (AIH), the African
    Development Bank (AfDB) provides an Open Data Platform (ODP) to all
    African countries. The key role of these portals is to facilitate
    statistical data access across Africa.

501. The ODP integrates many functionalities that allows countries to:

    6.  ***Upload and update databases on the system, ***

    7.  ***Create dynamic dashboards based on uploaded data,***

    8.  ***Share data with partners in different format (CSV, SDMX,
        ODATA, etc.).***

502. The portal also gives countries the opportunity to integrate data
    from NSOs and line ministries within the NSS. In the context of
    refugees and IDPs, the ODP could play a key role in facilitating
    access to this data in African countries already using the platform
    for their dissemination. This is already done for SDG data and
    macro-economic data, the refugees and IDP data could be easily
    integrated to the African countries' ODP.

503. Recently, African countries have populated SDG hubs, having
    installed them as part of the ODP and also developed 'National
    Summary Data Pages'. In this respect, a module could easily be added
    to the platform for disseminating refugees and IDP data.

504. The links (below) show examples for Mauritius and Kenya,
    respectively.

#### Other Examples of portals/platforms for the dissemination of statistics:

i.  ***EU Open Data Portal*** gives access to open data published by EU
    institutions and bodies (<https://data.europa.eu/euodp/en/home>),

ii. ***Knowledge Centre on Migration and Demography***, provides a
    single point of entry for information relevant to EU policies on
    migration and related fields
    (<https://bluehub.jrc.ec.europa.eu/portal/>)

iii. ***World Bank -- DataBank*** -- an analysis and visualisation tool
    that contains collections of time series data on a variety of
    topics. Users can create their own queries; generate tables, charts,
    and maps; and easily save, embed, and share them
    (<https://databank.worldbank.org/data/home.aspx>)

iv. ***OECD data portal*** gives access to charts, maps, tables and
    related publications (<https://data.oecd.org/>)

v.  ***International Organization for Migration -- Migration Data
    Portal***, aims to serve as an access point to information about
    migration data
    (<https://gmdac.iom.int/data-analysis-migration-data-portal>

vi. ***Devinfo*** tracks and disseminates key socio-economic development
    indicators ([www.devinfo.org](http://www.devinfo.org) ),

vii. ***NADA*** makes it possible to archive technical documents,
    metadata and microdata from surveys and censuses
    (<http://www.ihsn.org/software/nada>)

viii. ***REDATAM***-- facilitates the processing, analysis and
    dissemination of Statistics and Census
    (<https://redatam.org/redatam/en/index.html>)

ii. Canada: <https://open.canada.ca/en/open-data>

### New Output system {#new-output-system .ListParagraph}

505. An alternative to using one of these existing systems is the
    creation of a new portal exclusively dedicated to **\'Refugee and
    IDP statistics -- Open Data Portal\'.** In which case a choice must
    be made as to which organisation will create and maintain such a
    portal and what content will be offered.

506. The following options could be considered:

    9.  **Copy and centralise all content from various sources and
        present a full spectrum of \'Refugee and IDP statistics\'.**
        This option would require deep integration and data exchange
        between various stakeholders and therefore could be considered
        only as a long-term solution.

    10. **Create a centralised "dictionary" of all the \'Refugee and IDP
        statistics'.** This solution could be considered as a
        "quick-win" and would aim to be a centralised place with links
        to all relevant materials and dissemination products (portals,
        various products like databases, publications, leaflets, social
        media, etc...) from all engaged national agencies, and
        international bodies. Such a portal can act as a single point of
        access for collected data. However, the portal\'s structure can
        be decentralised, which means the data remains on the data
        provider\'s website and the provider is responsible for its
        quality and availability. All the respective metadata are also
        stored on the source portals and are managed by data providers.

507. In both scenarios it is important to consider the importance of
    international comparisons and standards.

### Data Portals -- guidelines[^5] {#data-portals-guidelines .ListParagraph}

508. There is a growing use of data portals among the NSOs (and regional
    and international agencies) for data dissemination. This is a
    positive development which allows for greater data availability and
    accessibility. It is recommended that statistical agencies take
    expert advice and access available information to support the
    selection of the system that meets their dissemination needs.

509. Links to examples of relevant guidelines include:

-   [*The Handbook on Major Statistical Data Management Platforms* by
    UNECA](https://nsdsguidelines.paris21.org/printpdf/node/798) *is an
    important resource for NSOs and can provide guidance during the
    decision-making process to help NSOs select the appropriate platform
    for managing and disseminating statistical data to their users.*

    criteria and evaluates relevant technology products according to
    those criteria.*

    *This paper offers lessons on how the deployment, design and
    technology considerations can be improved as NSOs enter the
    implementation and monitoring phase of the SDGs -- which will lead
    to a further push for data portals. The paper finds that while there
    have been many good intentions to make these portals available to
    countries, when it comes to actual implementation the outcomes are
    rather mixed. One particular problem is the set-up of multiple data
    portals with overlapping functionalities and their lack of
    integration -- particularly in the most aid-dependent countries.
    This results in (i) a duplication of workload for already
    resource-constrained NSOs who have to maintain several portals and
    update information manually, (ii) confusion for users who consult
    the various portals with often conflicting results, and (iii)
    overall high costs for demonstrably low usage of these portals.*

Produce dissemination products
-----------------------------------

510. This sub-process focuses on the production of the dissemination
    products, which should be designed in earlier sub-processes (i.e.
    Phase *2.1. Design Outputs*), however, it is presented here as a
    useful set of examples and best practices.

511. This sub-process focuses on three main aspects:

<!-- -->

i.  **"what**" will be produced: selecting from the options for
    dissemination products, e.g. downloadable files, analytical reports,
    interactive graphics, maps, public-use microdata sets;

ii. **"for whom"**, matching products to the types of users and their
    needs;

iii. **"how"** it will be produced, following standards and guidelines
    in order to produce quality assured products

### Dissemination products ("what") {#dissemination-products-what .ListParagraph}

512. The following Dissemination products are among the most widely
    used:

-   **Datasets** - multi-dimensional tables used to store the base data
    > and more appropriate for use by statistical and other experts via
    > special applications. For dissemination purposes the data
    > presented in the datasets should be aggregated to a level that is
    > safe to share and accompanied by relevant metadata.

-   **Predefined tables** - used to provide easy access to the main
    > statistical indicators. They are generally based on datasets and
    > are derived from them. They are predefined, non-modifiable and
    > present a limited number of dimensions.

<!-- -->

-   **Statistics explained articles** - contain statistical data and
    > explanations, but also direct links to all kinds of relevant
    > background information which may be useful to understand the
    > statistics.

-   User-friendly **leaflets, booklets, flyers, posters.**

-   **Statistical reports -** presenting a selection of data on specific
    > topics, including descriptive statistics that provide a general
    > picture of the findings.

-   **Digital publications** -- composed of short texts, dynamic
    > infographics, maps, videos, graphs, photos, etc.

-   **Visualisations**, including **maps and infographs** -
    > visualisation tools, which are easily understandable, interactive
    > and storytelling.

-   **Public-use micro-data sets and downloadable files** -- that
    > consist of sets of records containing information on individuals,
    > households or business entities. The files are created to allow
    > the general public to become familiar with statistical microdata.
    > The files are prepared in such a way that individual entities
    > cannot be identified, but with a consequent loss in information
    > value.

#### Examples of statistical reports:

514. The following reports are produced by the IoM using operational
    data.

<!-- -->

i.  Overview reports that cover all the data collected during the
    specified timeframe. These include descriptive statistics providing
    a general picture of the findings. There is no specific geographic
    subset of focus or analysis theme. The example is for **Turkey**
    - [Flow Monitoring Surveys Analysis (April 2019]{.underline})
    <https://migration.iom.int/reports/turkey-%E2%80%94%C2%A0flow-monitoring-surveys-analysis-april-2019?close=true>

ii. ***Thematic reports**:* focus on a specific research question,
    analysis theme (e.g. health, education or livelihoods, etc.) or
    population subset. This example is for [West and Central Africa -
    Youth and Mobility: Children and Youth on the Move Across West and
    Central Africa in 2018]{.underline} (April 2019).

    <https://migration.iom.int/reports/west-and-central-africa-%E2%80%94-youth-andmobility-children-and-youth-move-across-west-and-central?close=true>

iii. ***Sub regional reports**: similar to overview reports but focusing
    on a specific geographic area. This example is [South Sudan -
    Jonglei I Catalogue -Mobility Tracking Round 4.]{.underline}*

    <https://displacement.iom.int/reports/south-sudan-%E2%80%94-jonglei-i-catalogue-%E2%80%94-mobility-tracking-round-4?close=true>

iv. ***Brief report**:* shorter version of a narrative report
    summarizing the key findings. This report is [Europe --- Migrant
    Vulnerability to Human Trafficking and Exploitation
    (November 2017)]{.underline}

> <https://migration.iom.int/reports/europe-%E2%80%94-migrant-vulnerability-human-trafficking-and-exploitation-november-2017?close=true>

515. A model Report will depend on the availability and
    comprehensiveness of the data collected, however a structure
    suitable for refugee and IDP statistics will likely include:

-   **A Foreword**: usually written by an authority figure, presenting
    the report and highlighting its relevance. This can be procured in
    advance from the invited authority.

-   **Introduction/Executive Summary**: including a background context,
    justification for the exercise, description of the methodology, data
    collection period, locations covered, reference population, if
    applicable a description of the sampling and construction of
    weights, who was collecting data, limitations and constrains.
    Finally, the sections of the report should be presented and the main
    findings or most relevant figures/charts.

-   **Glossary**: if needed, it is recommended to include a glossary
    defining key terms in the beginning of the document.

-   **List of figures.**

-   **Suggested content sections:**

    **Demographics chapter**: providing the snapshot information of
    observed population groups based on sex-age and geographic
    disaggregation, household size; if available and applicable
    comparing changes with previous periods, also in terms of
    demographic balance (births and deaths). If available highlight
    vulnerable population (children and youth, women in vulnerability,
    disability, dismembered households).

    **Sectoral /living conditions chapters** (e.g. Housing, Education,
    Health, Employment): detailing the current living conditions of the
    observed population.

    **Mobility chapter**: focusing on the subset of the population that
    has moved in the last 12 months. It should outline places of origin
    and destination, habitual and current residence, as well as current
    displacement status (IDP, refugee or neither), and previous status
    if available.

###  {#section .ListParagraph}

### Users / recipients of the dissemination products ("for whom") {#users-recipients-of-the-dissemination-products-for-whom .ListParagraph}

517. The production of dissemination products must be adapted to the
    different users and their needs, particularly in the volume and
    detail of information required. Thus, there might be a need to have
    different user segments (as proposed below by the Task Force on
    Value of Official Statistics).[^6] Such segmentation can serve as a
    basis for constructing well-based production and communication of
    statistics. These user groups include:

    A. Users with a general interest

    -   Citizens

    -   Media and journalists

    -   Students and teachers

        B. Users with a pre-defined/structured interest

    <!-- -->

    -   International policies and monitoring frameworks

    -   International organizations

        C. Users with a specific subject/domain interest

    <!-- -->

    -   Decision makers

    -   Policy makers and analysts

    -   Marketing analysts

    -   Experts in a specific field

### Process ensuring proper creation of the dissemination products and best practices, guidelines ("how") {#process-ensuring-proper-creation-of-the-dissemination-products-and-best-practices-guidelines-how .ListParagraph}

519. When releasing the dissemination products, the style and formatting
    should be consistent and the quality of the product should be
    assured. At a simple level, the creation of dissemination products
    is composed of the following steps:

    13. Preparing the product components (explanatory texts, tables,
        charts, maps, quality statements etc.);

    14. Assembling the components into products;

    15. Editing the products and checking that they meet publication
        standards.

520. However, to ensure that quality standards are consistently met,
    statistical agencies should develop general guidelines for their
    publication products. Such publication guidelines are important for
    the following reasons[^8]:

    16. they improve the quality of the publications by making them more
        user-friendly,

    17. they set clear rules (that must be followed) and guidelines
        (that serve to advise) to facilitate the internal production
        process (and process of approval), by making it clear what the
        publication or website should contain and how this content
        should be structured and formatted.

    18. Examples of publication guides and guidance on disseminating
        results.

521. Manuals produced by UNECE: \"Making Data Meaningful\" guide series-
    Parts 1, 2, 3 and 4:
    <https://www.unece.org/stats/documents/writing/>

522. The **Making Data Meaningful** guides are intended as a practical
    tool to help managers, statisticians and media relations officers in
    statistical organizations to use text, tables, charts, maps and
    other devices to bring statistics to life for non-statisticians.

    Part 1: A guide to writing stories about numbers - providing
    guidelines and examples on the use of effective writing techniques
    to make data meaningful.

    Part 2: A guide to presenting statistics - providing guidelines and
    examples on preparing effective tables, charts and maps, and using
    other forms of visualizations to make data meaningful. It also
    offers advice on how to avoid bad or misleading visual
    presentations.

    Part 3: A guide to communicating with the media - helping producers
    of statistics find the best way to get their message across and to
    communicate effectively with the media. It contains suggestions,
    guidelines and examples.

    Part 4: A guide to improving statistical literacy - providing an
    overview of current initiatives and defining strategies for
    improving the statistical literacy of different user groups.

Manage release of dissemination products
---------------------------------------------

523. This sub-process should ensure that all elements for the release
    are in place. It includes managing the timing of the release,
    briefings for specific groups such as the press, as well as the
    arrangements for any pre-release embargoes. It also includes the
    provision of products to subscribers, and managing access to
    confidential data by authorised user groups, such as researchers and
    the error correction and notification policy.

524. Dissemination of statistical data to the wider public follows
    several dissemination principles set by dissemination polices. The
    management of the release of dissemination products requires careful
    planning and execution of the following aspects:

    19. **Data release** -- the statistical organization must ensure
        that all users have equitable and timely access to data that are
        disseminated to the public; there must be a clear guide for the
        users where they can find the data (on the respective
        portal/website and via different mobile apps),

    20. **Time of release and data extraction** -- the database should
        always contain the latest version of data; there should be
        regular intervals for the data\' updates; the statistical
        organization should minimize the interval between the period to
        which the data refer and the date when the product is released
        to the public; in case of revisions to the data after an initial
        release, the users must be notified about these changes in an
        equitable and timely manner; whenever preliminary data are
        released, they must be identified as preliminary; the ways that
        users can extract the data should be clearly explained (e.g.
        directly from the database or via \'bulk download\' facility),

        For example: Eurostat dissemination policy for Asylum statistics
        stares that updates are done twice a week on Tuesday and
        Thursday, at 11:00 am

    21. **Release calendar** should be available in advance of
        publication, e.g. prior to the beginning of the calendar year
        the statistical organization shall provide the users with a
        schedule of when statistical products are expected to be
        released during the upcoming year; such a calendar should be
        available on the portal/website and revised in a timely manner.

#### Examples  {#examples .ListParagraph}

> **Eurostat** release calendars:
> <https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/news/release-calendar>
>
> **Statistics Norway:**
> <https://www.ssb.no/en/omssb/lover-og-prinsipper/formidlingspolitikk/ssbs-statistikkalender>

22. **Relations with media** - when communicating with the media, two
    basic rules should be followed[^9]:

    a.  Equal treatment (all media should have access to releases of the
        new statistics at the same time),

    b.  Release calendar (all media should be informed about coming
        releases in advance in order to have some time for
        planning/research)

23. **Pre-release access/release of the statistical results under
    embargo** -- this is the privileged pre-release access that should
    be limited, controlled and publicised; such access should be well
    described and published by the statistical organisation; the
    respective document should set out how the organisation fulfils its
    responsibilities in this respect and gives details of the conditions
    of pre-release access.

#### Examples  {#examples-1 .ListParagraph}

> The '[*Protocol on impartial access to Eurostat data for
> users'*](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/10186/9268011/IMPARTIAL_ACCESS_2014_JAN-EN.PDF.pdf)
> [^10]sets out how Eurostat fulfils its responsibilities in this
> respect and gives details on the conditions of pre-release access.
>
> Eurostat signs specific Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the
> policy Directorates-General of the European Commission to allow the
> pre-release access to the statistical data.

24. **Error correction and notification --** a process of correcting
    > errors should be established; the respective instructions should
    > note errors both in online and printed statistical data and
    > include the central principles and the situations in which a
    > correction is required; errors when detected are recognised and
    > documented, and the respective corrections/revisions are duly,
    > rapidly and clearly disseminated to users.

> Luxembourg example - Error correction and data revision at STATEC:
>
> <https://statistiques.public.lu/en/actors/statec/policies/errors-revision/index.html>

25. **Access to microdata -** access to microdata should be restricted;
    e.g. for scientific purposes only; details and conditions on how to
    apply for microdata should be clearly explained;

#### Examples  {#examples-2 .ListParagraph}

i.  Eurostat examples: Eurostat pages dedicated to microdata access:

|                                                                       |
| The sixth United Nations Fundamental Principle of Official Statistics |
| is very clear on statistical confidentiality. Any principles for      |
| microdata access must be consistent with this Fundamental Principle.  |
|                                                                       |
| "Individual data collected by statistical agencies for statistical    |
| compilation, whether or not they refer to natural or legal persons,   |
| are to be strictly confidential and used exclusively for statistical  |
| purposes."                                                            |
|                                                                       |
| The following principles should be used for managing the              |
| confidentiality of microdata:                                         |
|                                                                       |
| Principle 1: It is appropriate for microdata collected for official   |
| statistical purposes to be used for statistical analysis to support   |
| research as long as confidentiality is protected.                     |
|                                                                       |
| Principle 2: Microdata should only be made available for statistical  |
| purposes.                                                             |
|                                                                       |
| Principle 3: Provision of microdata should be consistent with legal   |
| and other necessary arrangements that ensure that confidentiality of  |
| the released microdata is protected.                                  |
|                                                                       |
| Principle 4: The procedures for researcher access to microdata, as    |
| well as the uses and users of microdata, should be transparent and    |
| publicly available.                                                   |

26. **Data re-use and copyright --** the statistical organization should
    have a policy of encouraging free re-use of its data, both for
    non-commercial and commercial purposes, provided that the respective
    data source is clearly indicated,

    Example**:** Eurostat page dedicated to copyright notice and free
    re-use of data:

Promote dissemination products
-----------------------------------

525. Dissemination consists not only of the activities that are assumed
    with the data dissemination such as data publishing, but also
    activities related to the promotion of the dissemination products.
    Thus, this sub-process focusses on active promotion of the
    statistical products to help them reach the widest possible
    audience. It includes the use of different communication tools to
    reach the biggest audience and best facilitate the process of
    sharing statistical information with users:

### Conferences, public debates, fairs {#conferences-public-debates-fairs .ListParagraph}

526. Conferences, public debates and fairs are still very useful and
    powerful channels of communication as the target audience (i.e.
    users interested in a specific topic) is present in one place.
    Through panels with speakers, meetings with subject matter experts,
    distribution of promotion materials, the users have a unique
    opportunity to acquire up-to-date information.

527. The information on forthcoming conferences, public debates, and
    fairs can be found on:

-   UNHCR: <https://www.unhcr.org/conferences-and-meetings.html>

-   European Commission:
    <https://ec.europa.eu/migrant-integration/upcoming-events>

-   Research and Consulting on Migration and Asylum Policy Worldwide:
    <http://www.eurasylum.org/conferences/>

### Social media {#social-media .ListParagraph}

528. Social media can be a very useful tool in the dissemination and
    discussion of official statistics, as it offers tailor-made
    solutions to reaching individuals interested in official data. They
    are mainly used to distribute information, to promote the use of
    statistics and to increase statistical literacy. They can also be
    used to reach new audiences and to improve user support, as well as
    to receive user feedback and for marketing purposes.

529. Categories of social media to be taken into consideration[^13]:

    27. **Collaborative projects***,* **e.g. Wikipedia,** serve as an
        online database, allowing users to pool knowledge and
        information on particular topics to be viewed by other
        interested parties.

    28. **Blogs and microblogs, e.g. WordPress or Twitter**, are a type
        of website or part of a website maintained by an individual with
        regular entries of commentary, graphics or video. Many blogs
        provide commentary or news on a particular subject; others
        function as more personal online diaries.

    29. **Content communities, e.g. YouTube or Flickr, Delicious,**
        where users can upload, share, and view multimedia content such
        as videos, pictures, music or presentations.

    30. **Social networking sites, e.g. Facebook or LinkedIn,** are
        online services, platforms or sites that focus on building and
        reflecting social networks or social relations among people who
        share interests or activities.

### Other forms of dissemination - visualisation tools, mobile apps, GIS portals {#other-forms-of-dissemination---visualisation-tools-mobile-apps-gis-portals .ListParagraph}

530. **Data visualisation tools** present data in an attractive and
    easy-understandable way for everyone to explore. **Mobile apps**
    make it possible to access the data on mobile devises. **GIS
    Portals** are specialised platforms to display geodata on maps and
    provide tools to interact with the data.

Manage user support
------------------------

531. This sub-process ensures that user queries and requests for
    services such as microdata access are recorded, and that responses
    are provided within agreed deadlines. These queries and requests
    should be regularly reviewed to provide an input to the overarching
    quality management process, as they can indicate new or changing
    user needs.

532. Replies to user requests can also be used to populate a knowledge
    database or a "Frequently Asked Questions" page that is made
    publicly available, thus reducing the burden of replying to repeated
    and/or similar requests from external users.

533. User support provides assistance to all types of users: newcomers,
    sporadic visitors, more experienced users, journalists. For those
    who are visiting the portal/website for the first time a short
    \'first-time help\' video can be offered, while for all users there
    are replies to frequently asked questions. Additionally, the
    statistical agency can propose more personal user support for those
    who would like to submit questions in their national language.

534. If data are not available from the portal/website at the level of
    detail or in the format or layout the user requires, the respective
    user support service may be able to provide customised data to meet
    the user\'s specific requirements, e.g. tabulations not readily
    available from Eurostat\'s online database can be requested via
    their user support service.

535. In some NSOs, statistics on refugees and IDPs may be a new product
    for those responsible for user support so staff may need additional
    training on dealing with the topic, particularly as it may be
    perceived as controversial.

536. Elements to be considered while establishing the user support
    service:

    i.  Providing assistance to all types of users: newcomers, sporadic
        visitors or more experienced users. Example: Eurostat providing
        training to different policy Directorates-General of the
        European Commission on Asylum and managed migration statistics
