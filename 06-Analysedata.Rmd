Analyse Data
============

'"n this phase, statistical outputs are produced, examined in detail and
made ready for dissemination. It includes preparing statistical content
(including commentary, technical notes, etc.), and ensuring outputs are
\"fit for purpose\" prior to dissemination to customers. This phase also
includes the sub-processes and activities that enable statistical
analysts to understand the statistics produced. For statistical outputs
produced regularly, this phase occurs in every iteration. The
\"Analyse\" phase and sub-processes are generic for all statistical
outputs, regardless of how the data were sourced[^1]". (UNECE, 2013)

396. This section of the Compilers' Manual provides detailed guidance on
    the analysis required to produce the outputs specified in Phase 2.1
    Design Outputs (see paragraph 611). The outputs for displacement
    statistics can be divided into four categories;

    1.  Basic tabulations - estimates of counts and proportions of
        stocks and flows

    2.  Basic indicators (statistics, proportions and estimates)

    3.  SDG indicators recommended for refugees and IDPs

    4.  More complex analysis and commentary which might include an
        analysis of the integration of displaced people into host
        communities, the progress made towards overcoming key
        displacement-related vulnerabilities, and other key policy
        issues.

397. Taking point iv, the more complex analysis, the different
    indicators specified to measure aspects of displacement and
    integration are based on the indicator libraries of the *Integrated
    Household Survey Framework and the Durable Solution project*, as
    well as the recommended indicators included in the IRRS and IRIS.
    They include linkages to SDGs and form part of the reporting of the
    progress towards meeting the SDGs. In addition, analysis will
    measure progress towards durable solutions for IDPs, and of the
    integration for refugees into their host communities. It will also
    include the assessment of the end of IDP status for some members of
    the IDP stocks.

398. The analysis process includes two steps:

    5.  Utilizes the analytical framework specified in Phase 2.1
        "Design" to produce the statistical outputs required,

    6.  Interpretation, commentary and checking the outputs.

399. In essence, it covers the steps required to convert data into a
    variety of useable products for the users and potential users of
    statistics. Producing these products to the quality standards
    designated for official statistics is the ultimate goal of the
    statistical production process.

400. The text below reminds readers of the recommendations on outputs
    discussed in earlier phases of this Manual, and links these
    recommendations to some recent examples, some of which are cited in
    Part II - Case Studies and Examples section of this manual.

Prepare draft outputs
--------------------------

401. Much of the analysis phase will be pre-defined by selections made
    and priorities chosen at the Design phase discussed in Phase 2. This
    section sets out the basic outputs recommended in the earlier
    phases.

### Basic tabulations - estimates of counts and proportions of stocks and flows  {#basic-tabulations---estimates-of-counts-and-proportions-of-stocks-and-flows .ListParagraph}

402. Phase 2 Design defines stocks and flows. A stock corresponds to an
    already-defined category of individuals and refers to a set of
    characteristics. A stock refers to the total number of individuals
    who have a specific set of characteristics, at a specific moment in
    time. These characteristics, put together, define the status of
    these individuals.

403. For example, IDPs have a specific set of characteristics, which
    make them fit into this category. This is mainly the forced nature
    of their displacement, its origin being the habitual place of
    residence of the concerned persons or groups, the movement remaining
    within internationally recognised borders and the individuals having
    not yet found a durable solution to their displacement.

404. In contrast a refugee has been forcibly displaced by reason of a
    well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion,
    nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political
    opinion and is *"outside the country of his or her nationality, has
    crossed an internationally recognised border, and is unable to,
    owing to such a fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the
    protection of that country"*[^2] in need of international
    protection. The statistical categories recommended go beyond these
    definitions, in order to classify those with a refugee or IDP
    background and second-generation populations for statistical
    analysis (see relevant Chapters 3 in both IRRS, 2018 and IRIS,
    2020).

405. Flows affect this stock over time, either by making it increase
    ("in-flows") or decrease ("out-flows"). This in-flow corresponds to
    the number of individuals who acquire the characteristics of those
    in scope of the stock during a specified time period. For out-flows,
    it is the number of people who cease to be refugees or IDPs, e.g. by
    changes in status, death, birth or out-migration.

406. There can also be in-flows and out-flows between the sub-stocks,
    for example an asylum seeker who is granted refugee status is an
    outflow from the sub-stock of 'Asylum seekers', and an inflow into
    'Persons with determined status' (see IRRS, Figure 3.1). Therefore,
    there can be several stocks and flows, corresponding to the various
    classifications of populations being analysed. If the stocks are
    interconnected, i.e. if a person or group move from one status to
    another, the flows can also be interconnected; the out-flow from one
    stock can be the in-flow into another stock.

407. **The basic tabulations of refugee and refugee related stocks and
    flows** are set out in Phase 2 *2.1.1. Refugee statistics outputs*
    in Table 2.1 Basic Refugee Stock Tabulations and Table 2.2 Basic
    Refugee Flow Tabulations.

408. **The basic tabulations of IDPs and IDP related stocks and flows**
    are set out in Phase 2 *2.1.2. IDP statistics outputs* in Table
    2.5 - Basic IDP Flow Tabulations, which covers both outflows and
    inflows to the IDP and IDP-related stock, and Table 2.6 IDP Stock
    Tabulations.

409. These stock tabulations include both i) IDPs, ii) IDP-Related and
    iii). Those Who Have Overcome Key Displacement-Related
    Vulnerabilities. Some analysis will be required to identify the
    stock of the third category, and to estimate the flows of those who
    have been removed from the IDP stock because they *have overcome key
    displacement-related vulnerabilities.* Analysis will be needed to
    derive the variable in the databases which enables the analyst to
    identify those who have overcome those vulnerabilities, and to
    remove them statistically from stock. This is identification process
    described below in *section* *0,* but it should be noted that the
    full methodology for determining IDPs to be removed from stock is in
    its early stages. A more developed methodology will be added to
    future editions of this manual.

#### Refugee Example of reclassifying data to meet IRRS recommendations -- German Federal Statistics Office

410. 'In light of the mass influx between 2014 and 2016, the Federal
    Statistical Office of Germany explored the feasibility of
    complementing existing statistics on the inflow of refugees derived
    from asylum applications with information on the stock of foreigners
    living in Germany for humanitarian reasons. The concept was designed
    to take a comprehensive approach by not only including foreigners
    with a granted protection status but also foreigners with an asylum
    application still pending as well as foreigners who still remain in
    Germany after having been refused protection. Thereby, the approach
    follows the International Recommendations for Refugee Statistics
    that were recently adopted by the United Nations Statistical
    Commission. The concept relies on residence permit data obtained
    from the Central Register of Foreigners. This data allows
    identifying foreigners currently applying as well as foreigners
    having been granted or denied humanitarian protection. At the end of
    2016, about 1.6 million foreigners were identified as seeking
    humanitarian protection in Germany. That represents about 2 percent
    of the resident population and about 16 % of all resident
    foreigners. During to the recent surge in humanitarian immigration
    to Germany between 2014 and 2016, the stock has more than
    doubled'[^3].

411. Examples of the tabulations produced can be found in the link to
    the Asylum in Europe website[^4]
    <https://www.asylumineurope.org/reports/country/germany/statistics>

#### Refugee Example of basic stock tabulation -- Statistics Norway

412. An example of a basic stock tabulation is an example from
    Statistics Norway published in 2019. It provides a stock estimate
    together with a percentage change estimate for the net flow. An
    example of output is provided below, the first is taken from
    Statistics Norway (2019). Norway presents stock figures of '*persons
    with a refugee background*' with their reason for immigration, at
    the time they immigrated, and this departs from the IRRS as it does
    not present the stock by current refugee status.

#### IDP Example Georgia

416. Part II of this Manual provides an example of IDP tabulations
    derived from the General Population Census of 2014 in Georgia. The
    data can be accessed in the Census-related publications:
    <http://census.ge/en/publication>

417. The tables produced estimate;

    12. IDP\'s by age and sex (by Age, Urban/Rural and Sex); and

    13. IDP\'s by place of usual residence and place of residence before
        acquiring the IDP status (by Place of usual residence, Sex and
        place of residence before acquiring the IDP status).

#### IDP Example Colombia

418. Official statistics on displacement due to internal armed conflict
    in Colombia are published in Spanish in the website of the National
    Information Network of the Victims\` Unit
    (https://www.unidadvictimas.gov.co/es/registro-unico-de-victimas-ruv/37394).
    The website is open to the public and does not require any
    credentials.

419. The statistics related to the Effective Enjoyment of Rights are
    shared currently to the relevant government agencies in charge of
    social assistance in order to target access to aid and social
    programs. In this case, the dataset of the vulnerability assessment
    is shared via web through a secure site.

420. The following reports, regarding displacement are available at the
    website:

    14. Number of IDPs disaggregated per time of expulsion, time of
        > reception, time of declaration, with information presented
        > yearly and accumulated for the period before 1985.

    15. Number of IDPs disaggregated per differential approach into the
        > variables of ethnicity, sex, age and disability.

    16. Open data with numbers of IDPs mixing the above variables.

### Basic indicators (statistics, proportions and estimates) {#basic-indicators-statistics-proportions-and-estimates .ListParagraph}

421. Once the various stocks have been defined in the Design phase and
    the data collected, cleaned and input into databases, the variables
    and categories can be developed in the database ready for analysis.
    This requires a clear definition of the indicators and metrics to be
    used in the analysis

422. **The relevant Refugee Indicator** tables in Phase 2 are Table 2.3:
    Refugee Stock Indicators, Table 2.4: Refugee Flow Indicators both
    found at paragraphs 62 and 63 of this Manual.

423. **The relevant IDP Indicator** tables in Phase 2 is *Table 2.8: Key
    stock indicators of IDP, IDP-related, and those who have overcome
    key displacement related vulnerabilities.* These indicators include
    the length of time the IDP was displaced; the location of the IDPs
    and if they have returned to their habitual places of residence,
    been resettled or are in locations of displacement; and proportions
    of women and children among the IDPs.

### SDG indicators recommended for refugees and IDPs  {#sdg-indicators-recommended-for-refugees-and-idps .ListParagraph}

424. In the years leading up to 2030, the SDGs will play an important
    role in policy discussions. During the 2020 Comprehensive Review of
    the SDG indicator framework, a specific indicator on refugees was
    included in the framework, but there is no specification for other
    forcibly displaced populations, including IDPs. However, the issue
    cuts across many SDGs, and multiple indicators can be disaggregated
    by migratory status and, more specifically, by displacement status.
    When SDG indicators are collected as part of statistics on forced
    displacement it is recommended that countries use the SDG framework
    and metadata in developing the statistics.

Table 6.2: Recommended SDG Indicators to be disaggregated by forced
displacement by priority policy areas (IRIS Table 4.1)

  **Policy Area 1: Basic needs and living conditions**        
  ----------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  6.1.1                                                       Proportion of population using safely managed drinking water services
  11.1.1                                                      Proportion of urban population living in slums, informal settlements or inadequate housing
  **Policy Area 2: Livelihoods and economic self-reliance**   
  1.2.1                                                       Proportion of population living below the national poverty line, by sex and age
  4.1.1                                                       Proportion of children and young people (a) in grades 2/3; (b) at the end of primary; and (c) at the end of lower secondary achieving at least a minimum proficiency level in (i) reading and (ii) mathematics, by sex
  7.1.1                                                       Proportion of population with access to electricity
  8.3.1                                                       Proportion of informal employment in non‑agriculture employment, by sex
  8.5.2                                                       Unemployment rate, by sex, age and persons with disabilities
  **Policy Area 3: Civil, political and legal rights**        
  1.4.2                                                       Proportion of total adult population with secure tenure rights to land, (a) with legally recognized documentation, and (b) who perceive their rights to land as secure, by sex and type of tenure
  16.1.4                                                      Proportion of population that feel safe walking alone around the area they live
  16.9.1                                                      Proportion of children under 5 years of age whose births have been registered with a civil authority, by age

425. The Inter-Agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators accepted the
    proposal of EGRIS members to recommend disaggregation by forced
    displacement categories for 12 priority SDG indicators, as well as
    further broken down by age and sex whenever possible.[^5] In order
    to ensure availability of minimum quality statistics on refugees and
    IDPs, it is recommended that national statistics providers include
    statistics on these priority indicators in the reporting plans for
    the 2030 Agenda. However, governments should not feel limited to
    this priority list, and data collection on additional indicators is
    encouraged.

426. A second initiative, the Expert Group meeting on Improving
    Migration Data in the Context of the 2030 Agenda,[^6] has identified
    another 12 indicators which they recommend be disaggregated by
    migratory status. Both selected lists of SDG indicators are a useful
    resource for identifying indicators to measure the characteristics
    of IDPs within the criteria set forth by the IASC Framework.

427. Matching the collected data with the defined metrics and
    indicators, stocks and flows, can be done in various ways, depending
    on the data collection method used. Stock data can be populated
    based on questions asked within surveys and census, that aim to
    directly determine if and how many people match the selected
    characteristics for each type of stock (e.g. a survey with a
    question such as "have you been forced to leave your place of
    residence in the last x months/years?"), or using data obtained from
    registers of IDPs or refugees (see Phase 2).

428. This might include an analysis of the integration of displaced
    people into host communities, the progress made towards overcoming
    key displacement-related vulnerabilities, and other key policy
    issues. The body of literature available is extensive, and guidance
    can be obtained in the IRRS, 2018 and the IRIS, 2020.

#### IRRS Recommendations {#irrs-recommendations .ListParagraph}

429. From a legal perspective, durable solutions for refugees occur when
    refugees can once again enjoy the protection of a state, either
    through voluntary repatriation to their country of origin,
    integration in their host country, or resettlement to a third
    country. However, given the protracted nature of many conflicts,
    repatriation is not an immediate prospect for most refugees, and
    resettlement and naturalization are solutions for only a small
    minority. In reality, the majority of refugees aspire to, or enjoy,
    de facto integration in their host countries. Rather than a one-off
    event, the integration of refugees involves an incremental process.
    The IRRS focuses on the satisfaction of refugees' immediate and
    ongoing needs, their access to rights and on their integration.
    Living conditions can serve as a proxy for the satisfaction of these
    needs, and as data about peoples' living conditions have been
    routinely collected across the world for over 25 years, the results
    for the general population are already widely available. The
    satisfaction of basic needs, and the acquisition of rights is the
    first step in the integration of refugees.

430. Refugees have particular challenges compared to general migrants.
    Due to the forced nature of their migration and the traumatic
    experiences frequently associated with it, they often suffer from
    psychological distress and disabilities. Moreover, unlike labour
    migrants who tend to settle where their skills can be used more
    productively than in their home country, refugees may settle in
    areas with limited or no employment or other livelihood
    opportunities.

431. The IRRS presents recommendations for indicators that can be used
    to measure satisfaction of needs, access to rights and the
    integration of refugees with their host country or original country
    communities. The recommendations are grouped into three levels of
    indicators: priority, second level, and third level indicators.
    Table 5.1 of the IRRS presents the proposed indicators organized by
    the dimension of need and integration that it measures, specifically
    the following: (a) legal; (b) civil-political; (c) demographic and
    migration; (d) education; (e) economic; (f) social inclusion;
    and (g) health. In addition, several core classificatory variables
    are also recommended for the production of comparative analyses.

432. These classificatory variables are cross-referenced to those
    tabulations recommended earlier in Phase 2.1. These include country
    of birth, age, sex, reason for migrating, legal status, citizenship
    and length of time in the host country. Length of residence in the
    host country is especially important for statistics on integration
    because integration is a temporal process that begins when the
    refugee arrives in the host country. The pace of integration is
    usually different for refugee and refugee related groups compared
    with general migrants.

433. The characteristics of age and sex are used to disaggregate
    indicators of refugee living conditions and integration. For
    instance, using the sex variable to look at the difference in
    employment status between male and female refugees can highlight
    gender differences for that indicator. Classificatory variables are
    described in detail *in* *Table 2.9: Variables for refugee
    statistics*. As far as possible the proposed indicators correspond
    with those of the SDGs. Where they correspond, the equivalent SDG
    indicators have been noted in IRRS Table 5.1, the correspondence is
    often not direct. Guidance is given on the composition of the
    proposed indicators. Additionally, metadata for the SDG indicators
    are published by the United Nations Statistical Division on their
    website.[^7] The last column of Table 5.1 gives the closest SDG
    indicator equivalence, it is not proposed that all these indicators
    are used.

434. The Indicators of integration and the satisfaction of immediate and
    ongoing needs of refugees and refugee related populations are:

    17. Legal indicators

    18. Civil-political indicators

    19. Demographic and migration indicators

    20. Education indicators

    21. Economic indicators

    22. Social inclusion indicators

    23. Health indicators

#### IRIS Recommendations {#iris-recommendations .ListParagraph}

435. In 2015, an interagency process was established to operationalise
    the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) Framework. Under the
    leadership of the Mandate of the UN Special Rapporteur on the Human
    Rights of IDPs, a group of development, humanitarian and
    peacebuilding actors started work on developing and testing
    indicators and guidance for comprehensive durable solutions analysis
    in internal displacement situations and to measure progress over
    time. The work, coordinated by the Joint IDP Profiling Service,
    resulted in a library of standardised indicators and guidance for
    the operationalization of the eight IASC[^8] criteria.

436. For a statistical approach for measuring progress towards durable
    solutions and whether key-displacement related vulnerabilities have
    been overcome. Two measures are proposed:

    24. The durable solutions progress measure designed to show the
        change in the share of IDPs who have overcome vulnerabilities
        linked to the criteria of the IASC Framework on Durable
        Solutions for IDPs over time. Therefore, this measure will be
        able to show whether progress is being made in overcoming the
        different vulnerabilities, and cumulatively, the progress made
        towards the achievement of durable solutions.

    25. The composite measure designed to specify whether all key
        displacement-related vulnerabilities have been overcome and
        thus, whether or not persons with displacement-related
        protection needs and vulnerabilities can be taken out of the
        total IDP stock.

437. For the purpose of statistically measuring durable solutions
    progress, displacement-related vulnerabilities, sub-criteria were
    specified for each of the eight IASC criteria as is shown in Table
    6.3 Criteria and sub-criteria included in the composite measure
    (IRIS, Table 4.3) below. The first four criteria of the IASC
    Framework are relevant in all contexts and should therefore always
    be included. The last four should be considered and can be included
    if deemed relevant for the specific displacement context. Therefore,
    all eight criteria are included in recommendations to measure
    progress towards durable solutions (see IRIS, paragraph 146).
    Regarding the development of the composite measure for overcoming
    key displacement-related vulnerabilities, a smaller set of criteria
    are chosen, including the four deemed to always be relevant in
    displacement contexts. Given the prevalence of challenges linked to
    lack of documentation in many displacement settings, it is also
    recommended to include the fifth criteria on access to personal and
    other documentation in any statistical measure that can result in
    taking IDPs out of the stock. This measure therefore prioritises
    five of the eight criteria (see IRIS, paragraph 164).

438. For each sub-criterion, there are many different indicators which
    can be chosen, although a final list has not yet been agreed. The
    indicators selected in each national context should, as far as
    possible, be aligned with already tested and standardized
    indicators. The Durable Solutions indicator library provides a
    thorough overview of potential options (see Durable Solutions
    Library[^9]). Where relevant, they should also mirror the SDG
    indicators recommended to be disaggregated by different categories
    of displacement. Indicators selected should be carefully chosen to
    ensure they are relevant for all three sub-stocks of the displaced
    population: IDPs in locations of displacement, IDPs in locations of
    return and IDPs in other settlement locations.

439. A preliminary proposal of indicators for the sub-criteria has been
    developed by the EGRIS' IDP subgroup (see IRIS for discussion of
    indicator selection), taking into consideration the above listed
    aspects. The aim of this work was to provide a short, manageable
    list of one or two indicators per sub-criteria. However, given the
    limited availability of data, particularly for the sub-criteria
    which experts determined to be displacement-specific, it is too
    preliminary to recommend a final list of indicators for each
    sub-criterion at this stage. Further testing is required to detail
    out this proposal. As this work progresses, information will be
    added to future editions of the Compilers' Manual, including
    implications for target setting based on different types of
    indicators (see IRIS, paragraph 166). Once finalized an updated
    version of these Recommendations could be considered. In the
    meantime, countries and international organisations should use the
    durable solutions indicator library as a reference and starting
    point for indicator selection and should as far as possible follow
    principles described (see IRIS, paragraphs 135-137).

Table 6.3 Criteria and sub-criteria included in the composite measure
(IRIS, Table 4.3)

  ----------------------------------------------- ---- -------------------------------------------
  Criteria                                             Sub-criteria
  1\. Safety and security                         1    1.1 Victims of violence
                                                  2    1.2 Freedom of movement
  2\. Adequate standard of living                 3    2.1 Food security
                                                  4    2.2 Shelter and housing
                                                  5    2.3 Medical services
                                                  6    2.4 Education
  3\. Access to livelihoods                       7    3.1 Employment and livelihoods
                                                  8    3.2 Economic security
  4\. Restoration of housing, land and property   9    4.1 Property restitution and compensation
  5\. Access to documentation                     10   5.1 Documentation
  ----------------------------------------------- ---- -------------------------------------------

440. The targets for each sub-criterion should be defined. A comparative
    approach against the general/national population is recommended. If
    determined relevant by the national context a sub-set thereof can be
    used for this purpose.

441. The two measures on progress and the composite measure, should be
    used for the production of official statistics on internal
    displacement.

    26. The durable solutions progress measure designed to show the
        change in the share of IDPs who have overcome vulnerabilities
        linked to the criteria of the IASC Framework on Durable
        Solutions for IDPs over time; and

    27. The composite measure designed to specify whether all key
        displacement-related vulnerabilities have been overcome and
        thus, whether or not persons with displacement-related
        protection needs and vulnerabilities can be taken out of the
        total IDP stock.

442. Over time, as new data are collected and more testing conducted in
    different national contexts, the recommended progress and composite
    measures can be further refined, including a list of agreed
    indicators and other relevant guidance. This will be included in
    future versions of this manual.

#### Example Colombia 

443. The example in Part II paragraph 573 of this manual onwards
    describes the *Use of administrative records to assess displacement
    related vulnerabilities in Colombia.* The Socio Economic
    Re-establishment Index is used to determine the extent of their
    vulnerability, and are assessed as no longer having vulnerabilities
    once the SRI is equal to one.

#### Example Sudan Darfur: Measuring Progress Towards Durable Solutions

444. The Government of Sudan and the international community are working
    together to jointly support durable solutions for Darfur's
    internally displaced people. The commitment is rooted in the Doha
    Document for Peace in Darfur (DDPD) from 2011, signed by the
    Government of Sudan, other major parties to the conflict and the
    international community, and which sets out the framework for peace
    in Darfur.

445. A durable solutions process was piloted in El Fasher in North
    Darfur. To reach durable solutions and end displacement, long-term
    planning based on agreed and jointly-owned comprehensive data is
    needed. To establish an agreed evidence base, a collaborative
    profiling approach was adopted that brought actors together to
    ensure trust and ownership of the results of the profiling exercise.
    An important aspect of this durable solutions profiling is that it
    places IDPs centre-stage alongside the two other major
    stakeholders---the Government of Sudan and the international
    community---permitting the profiling results and recommendations to
    be owned and signed off by all parties.

446. The durable solutions profiling exercise in El Fasher specifically
    aims to:

    28. Provide a comprehensive profile of IDPs residing in Abu Shouk
        and El Salaam IDP camps.

    29. Develop a better understanding of IDPs' vulnerabilities, coping
        mechanisms, capacities and provide insight into IDPs'
        perceptions and their future settlement intentions.

    30. Provide a jointly agreed upon data set to help inform durable
        solutions programming responses.

    31. Pilot a profiling exercise of displacement and joint durable
        solutions planning that could be replicated in other Sudan
        contexts with displaced populations.

447. The profiling exercise adopted the Inter-Agency Standing Committee
    (IASC) Framework on Durable Solutions for Internally Displaced
    Persons as an analytical framework. The profiling was designed to
    take into account the displaced persons' perspectives on durable
    solutions including preferred settlement options and places a strong
    emphasis on understanding the rationale behind these preferences. It
    is also concerned with understanding the progress IDP communities
    have made across the IASC durable solutions criteria and applied an
    area-based comparative approach.

448. This comparative analysis was used to understand whether hardships
    are a result of IDPs' displacement or development challenges shared
    with non-displaced communities in El Fasher. Finally, it included a
    macrolevel urban analysis. The profiling exercise used mixed
    methods: mapping and enumeration, a household survey, and key
    informant interviews. The profiling applied a gender lens and
    questions for further analysis, which were included in the report
    narrative when significant gender related differences were
    identified. The repost gives details of the indicators used as part
    of the profiling exercise. Link

#### Example Norway Refugee Labour Market Analysis

449. Statistics Norway publishes a report every year describing the
    labour market situation for the refugee workforce population (15-66
    years old) settled in Norway under its Refugee and the Labour Market
    technical series. The report is based on the register-based
    employment statistics of Norway.

450. It is important to understand the necessity of producing such
    statistical analysis from Statistics Norway's perspective. The
    participation of the refugees in the labour market is an imperative
    to understand the underlying driving forces for the refugee
    integration in the host countries' labour market. The result of the
    analysis is pivotal in designing effective policy responses to
    integrate the refugees, asylum seekers in the host communities in
    Norway. The outcome of the analysis will aid the Norwegian policy
    makers as well as the programme planners with a solid baseline /
    starting point to assess the impact of an intended policy or
    programme and at the same time will pave the way for further
    improvement in the policy.

#### Nepal Example -- mobile phone tracking of population displacement

451. Using alternative data sources from mobile phone records Flowminder
    and Ncell collaborated with UN OCHA and other disaster relief
    agencies to estimate the number of people displaced. See Part II of
    this Manual *Nepal*.

#### South Sudan Example: Poverty Assessment

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 452. South Sudan's National Bureau of Statistics and the World Bank   |
|     conducted the fourth wave of the High Frequency Survey and the    |
|     Crisis Recovery Survey to monitor welfare and perceptions of      |
|     citizens in accessible urban areas and IDP camps across South     |
|     Sudan. The HFS and CRS data contains information on security,     |
|     economic conditions, education, employment, access to services,   |
|     and perceptions. The data combines detailed household             |
|     questionnaire information with displacement-specific information  |
|     including drivers of displacement, access to resettlement         |
|     mechanisms, and return intentions. It also includes comprehensive |
|     information on assets and consumption, to allow estimation of     |
|     poverty based on the Rapid Consumption methodology as detailed in |
|     Pape and Mistiaen (2015).                                         |
|                                                                       |

| 454. The statistical series was started as a result of the dramatic   |

|     community about the location and needs of the displaced           |
|     populations. The data was collected using the IOM's Displacement  |

| 455. The data collection will seek to identify the local demographic  |
|     profile, displacement dynamics, and to answer the following       |
|     questions;                                                        |

Validate outputs
---------------------

460. This sub-process is where statisticians validate the quality of the
    outputs produced, in accordance with a general quality framework
    (developed in Phase 2) and with expectations based on local
    knowledge. This sub-process also includes activities involved with
    the gathering of intelligence, with the cumulative effect of
    building up a body of knowledge about a specific statistical domain.
    This knowledge is then applied to the current collection, in the
    current environment, to identify any divergence from expectations
    and to allow informed analyses. Validation activities can include
    checking the population coverage in the sample group and looking for
    content errors.

461. An example is Population Census coverage that can involve two or
    three major problems such as under representation, over
    representation, and selection bias in the study design. The most
    common problem is under-representation of the population in the
    sample group or due to selection bias in the research design.
    Generally, an aggregate undercount of 3 to 6% is considered
    acceptable, but some population groups tend to be disproportionately
    affected, e.g. very young children, young mobile men and
    undocumented migrants. Over-coverage also happens, especially if
    local authorities, with an interest in exaggerating their
    populations, are able to influence the data collection.

462. Content errors might involve non-response bias and response bias
    for some of the key variables in the data collection phase.
    Individual data are often provided by an informant who is either the
    head of household or another responsible adult household member.
    These proxy respondents may not know all the details regarding each
    member of the households, or sometimes may not want to share the
    facts. The household members themselves may be unsure or
    misunderstand the question. They may even hide or distort
    information on purpose (see also under-reporting of
    consumption[^10]. As a result, data quality may be poor, despite
    excellent coverage. Therefore, it is necessary to detect those
    errors in the in the analysis phase and select the right analysis
    techniques to eradicate or minimise the content error.

463. There are several methods for quality assessment. Content errors
    can often be detected through internal consistency analysis by
    crosschecking the data across different datasets. Furthermore, the
    analyst can resort to the following mechanisms to validate the
    findings:

-   Comparing the statistics with previous cycles (if applicable and
    > available),

-   Checking that the associated metadata and paradata (process
    > metadata) are present and in line with the expectations,

-   Checking the statistics for consistency against other relevant data
    > (both internal and external), comparing with other national
    > sources, operational and global data,

-   Investigating inconsistencies in the statistics,

-   Agreeing with the accepted threshold level in applying the quality
    > standards and validation processes

-   Performing macro editing, and

-   Validating the statistics against expectations and domain
    > intelligence.

464. The main criteria are: is the data understandable, usable for
    analysis and fit for purpose, particularly the purpose that was
    articulated in the Design phase. Does it respond to the questions
    that were set initially?

465. Comparators are important, either from another dataset relating to
    a similar group or population, or to the same group/population
    across different time periods. Particularly important is coherence
    when comparing datasets are those obtained via different methods
    (e.g. surveys versus registration). Although the figures obtained
    via different methods will not always match, they need to show clear
    relative trends, to allow comparability. The availability of good
    metadata for both datasets will enable judgments to be made about
    the reasons for differences and for a judgement to be made about the
    quality of the data.

466. The ***analytical framework*** should include ***commentary and
    notes***, to allow proper understanding of how the data was obtained
    and treated, in order to support the accessibility and credibility
    of the results. This commentary should be accompanied by clear
    explanatory metadata pertaining to how the data were collected,
    processed and analysed (see Phase 7 on metadata)

467. Complement the estimates with ***contextual updates***, to inform
    the reader and to allow for better understanding of trends. If
    numbers go up, does this correspond to greater coverage, or to an
    increase in violence, attacks or incidence of disasters. Try to
    explain what the likely correlates are.

468. ***Triangulation***: use operational data for comparison,
    particularly for flow data, as operational data is more likely to
    capture micro-movements, spontaneous movements, short-term
    displacements. It is necessary to make sure the trends match between
    the various datasets without any major deviation. If the variation
    between two stocks is not significant, but operational data
    identifies a high number of smaller, shorter term movements (e.g. in
    the case of preventative evacuations leading to quick returns, or
    mass movements leading to cross border returns), then this should
    allow official statistics to verify/correct their flow data.

469. Linking to cross border data, ***interoperability***: if movements
    lead to significant cross-border flight or returns, the datasets on
    both sides of the border should correspond with each other to ensure
    validity. Refugee data could be compared to third country nationals,
    refugees, migrants in other countries, to validate estimates and
    trends. Example: the stocks of IDPs in South Sudan only increase
    marginally between two data collection periods; however, the number
    of South Sudanese nationals in the Central African Republic increase
    exponentially, then the likelihood is that people were displaced
    over the border. Operational flow data from displacement event
    should reflect that significant variation, even if the stocks do
    not.

470. Even if variations in operational flow data from incidents do not
    match variations in stocks, the differences between the different
    stock types should be proportional. However, an increase in the
    number of displacements does not mean that a similar same increase
    will appear in stocks, as those displacements could relate to the
    same people being displaced on multiple occasions. For example, if
    the numbers of IDPs in an area decreases, the numbers corresponding
    to that decrease should be reflected in another stock, e.g. there
    are 10,000 less IDPs in Borno State in Nigeria, because there are
    10,000 more Nigerian refugees in Cameroon.

#### Example of using several data sources to validate data: The Welfare of Syrian Refugees: 

471. **This joint publication** of UNHCR and World Bank on the welfare
    of Syrian Refugees (2016) aimed to increase the understanding and
    ultimately improve the well-being of Syrian refugees. Due to the
    overwhelming humanitarian response, there was an abundance of data
    on the vulnerability, well-being and access to basic services
    aspects of the Syrian refugees. These data had not yet been fully
    explored and utilised for analytical, policy, and planning purposes
    at that time. The report used different sources of data to
    understand the vulnerability and poverty conditions among the Syrian
    refugees.

Interpret and explain outputs
---------------------------------

473. This sub-process calls upon the in-depth expertise of statisticians
    to understand, interpret and explain the statistics produced by
    assessing how well the findings reflect their initial expectations.
    This involves viewing the statistics from all perspectives using
    different tools and media, and also carrying out in-depth
    statistical analyses.

474. The analyst should check to see if the data respond to the question
    that were initially set and do the outputs match what was determined
    in the Design phase? A basic analysis might ask the following
    questions:

    36. What are the variations from one reporting period to another?

    37. Are those variations attributed to contextual or methodological
        considerations or both? (i.e. more to do with displacement
        trends or to do with the data collection and treatment methods)

    38. Are the variations consistent across the entire context in scope
        of the analysis? Are there different trends within that scope?
        How can these be explained?

    39. How are stocks and flows affected by the changes? Has one
        indicator changed more than others, i.e. have flows
        increased/decreased significantly whereas stocks have changed
        more marginally?

    40. Which flows have changed the most, and what does this tell us?
        E.g. has the number of IDPs increased/decreased much more in
        comparison with cross-border flight and refugee numbers abroad?

    41. Have methodologies changed? If so, why? How does this impact the
        accuracy and comparability of the analysis?

    42. Do the variations in numbers correspond to contextual changes
        that can explain them?

    43. Which groups, as highlighted by the sex and age disaggregated
        data (SADD) and other forms of disaggregation, are the most
        impacted? Why? Has that changed since the last reporting period?

    44. Do the official statistics vary significantly in relation to
        other datasets produced by other sources, particularly
        operational actors? If so, why?

    45. Do the variations correlate with specific actions taken to
        prevent or solve situations of displacement/provision of
        assistance/interventions/any form of state operation?

#### Example of Interpretation of outputs using multiple datasets: Humanitarian Shelter

475. "The State of Humanitarian Shelter and Settlements" report by
    Global Shelter Cluster (GSC) report provided an in-depth review of
    the evidence base of the shelter and settlements sector, and the
    sector's data collection practices. One of the main difficulties
    encountered when attempting to measure shelter adequacy is obtaining
    accurate data across various contexts. This is due partly to the
    multi-sectoral nature of the criteria, and the wide range of
    environments in which humanitarian agencies work, as well as to
    variations between shelter designs, materials and costs. In
    addition, different adequacy indicators may sometimes conflict with
    each other. Most shelter actors therefore agree that a
    one-size-fits-all definition of adequacy is almost impossible.

476. To compare and analyse the data, GSC created a sub-set of
    information in order to gather data for disasters, conflicts and
    crises between 2013 and 2018 for which a Shelter Cluster (SC)
    response or SC-like response had been activated. The methodology is
    explained in detail in Part 3 of this report
    [https://www.sheltercluster.org/sites/default/files/The State of
    Humanitarian Shelter and Settlements
    2018.pdf](https://www.sheltercluster.org/sites/default/files/The%20State%20of%20Humanitarian%20Shelter%20and%20Settlements%202018.pdf)

Apply disclosure control
-----------------------------

477. At the Design phase, the outputs should be designed with a clear
    understanding of the required information needed from those outputs
    to respond to the agreed questions. This should dictate how much
    information is necessary to collect, and what falls outside of that
    scope.

478. Due consideration should be given to privacy in accordance with
    national and international law, and to any type of information that
    could lead to the respondents being identified or suffering from
    discrimination as a result of their participation or responses in a
    survey/census should not be disclosed.

479. Disclosure should also include considerations of interoperability:
    how datasets on different population types talk to each other, their
    ability to share information on those populations, or even on
    specific individuals, their characteristics and their needs. This
    can enable possibilities for combining datasets to improve coverage
    and quality (see section on *Data Source D: Integrated Data*). This
    can also help prevent duplication of data. A data protection policy
    should be in place from the start, and Phase 2D discusses the *a.
    Legal environment and data protection legislation* and the other
    capacity requirements for this.

480. Data integration may be possible where the data being collected by
    various government databases relates to individuals, groups or
    populations who are registered in one or more government databases.
    Inter-agency data sharing protocols can enable this and also help to
    prevent duplication. As the various service needs of the concerned
    populations are likely to be addressed by different entities within
    the government (or even by entities outside of it), data sharing
    between those entities will ensure greater capacity for analysis.

481. There are technical computer languages that allow data sharing more
    effectively, such as tagging, e.g. using HXL, allowing the data
    outputs to be identifiable by various data sharing platforms, and
    for the various elements of the datasets to be identified and shared
    individually as well.

482. For an example of how anonymisation is done by different
    governments and the decision rules that are applied to enforce it.
    See Canadian Example of a secure data enclaves and data use offering
    higher levels of security, IRRS, Box 6.4.

Finalise outputs
---------------------

483. Final outputs and datasets must come packaged with all the fields
    or variables fully explained, with good metadata. The metadata
    should explain anything that might have affected the accuracy or
    quality of the data. Data treatments, weighting and any other
    transformations such as derived variables should be fully documented
    and made available to users.

484. It is crucial to account for any caveats/limitations that may
    affect the data and therefore prevent analysis, as well as
    comparability. An example of a caveat would be to specify the
    geographical coverage of the datasets. This should include coverage
    problems which have resulted from difficulty of access in particular
    locations. All caveats must be detailed: specific to each collection
    method, highlighting any potential difference in the collection
    exercises at different times, obstacles met preventing the data to
    be collected according to the parameters set in the Design phase,
    and include calculations of the sampling errors which apply to key
    estimates.

485. The outputs should also specify what quality assurance and quality
    control mechanisms were applied, and the findings of the quality
    assessments should be made available to users.
