<p>‘This phase is triggered when a need for new statistics is identified,
or feedback about current statistics initiates a review. It includes
all activities associated with engaging customers to identify their
detailed statistical needs, proposing high level solution options and
preparing business cases to meet these needs. In this phase the
organisation: identifies the need for the statistics; confirms, in
more detail, the statistical needs of the stakeholders; establishes
the high level objectives of the statistical outputs; identifies the
relevant concepts and variables for which data are required; checks
the extent to which current data sources can meet these needs;
prepares the business case to get approval to produce the statistics’

<li>A comprehensive approach to understanding and specifying statistical
needs will help to make national statistical systems meet users’
needs, or in the case of a new statistical series potential users’
needs. The development of a roadmap for statistical development can
be guided by several tools and guidelines developed by PARIS21 based
at OECD. <em>Figure 1.1: Tools available to support establishing a
business case</em> shows the sub-processes set out the GSBPM and
indicates where tools are available for establishing a business
case. These are discussed below.</li>

<li><p>Advocacy from regional and international authorities can play a
crucial part in raising the priority given to refugee and IDP
statistics by governments, planning authorities and chief
statisticians. Effective advocacy includes explicitly documenting
and specifying the unaddressed needs, targeting a group within the
national statistical system that can effect change, proposing a
detailed business case for closing the data gap, and using hard
evidence as a basis for the business case. Joint approaches in
strengthening national statistical systems, whether regional or
international, have often been more effective than individual
national efforts in capacity building and fundraising for emerging
areas of official statistics, such as refugee and IDP statistics.</p></li>
<li><p>As the international statistical system derives its input from
national statistical systems, establishing a business case for a new
statistical series requires substantial planning and co-ordination
at national and international levels alike. Nationally, the
production of refugee and IDP statistics can require several
ministries, departments or agencies to cooperate with the national
statistics office (NSO) to make the resulting statistics fit for
purpose and relevant to users (Eurostat, 2018).</p></li>

<li><p>The IRRS and IRIS recommendations propose a list of basic data
tabulations (IRRS Chapter 3 and IRIS Chapter 5) and indicators (IRRS
Chapter 5 and IRIS Chapter 4) to be produced at the national level.
These recommendations serve as the core set of official statistics
in the displacement domain which includes refugee and related
persons; and internally displaced persons. However, a country’s
range of statistics will vary, depending on the national policy
priorities and the reporting requirements of regional international
users, and the capacity of the National Statistical System and what
statistics are possible to produce with a reasonable effort</p></li>
<li><p>In respect of international reporting obligations, it should be
noted that the Inter-Agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators
accepted the proposal of EGRIS members to recommend disaggregation
by forced displacement categories for 12 priority SDG indicators, as
well by age and sex whenever possible.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> In order to ensure
availability of minimum quality statistics on refugees and IDPs, it
is recommended that national statistics providers include statistics
on these priority indicators in the reporting plans for the 2030
Agenda. However, governments should not feel limited to this
priority list, and data collection on additional indicators is
encouraged (IRIS, paragraph 130).</p></li>
<li><p>There are several potential users of statistics on displaced
persons, including governments and national authorities, local
authorities, international organisations, civil society, NGOs,
researchers/academia, the media and the general public. They have
different needs and priorities, requiring statistics for different
purposes:</p></li>

<li><p>Identifying important “needs gaps” and users’ priorities requires
research. Which can involve a mixed-methods approach, using a
combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods. A
useful source of information on the needs of both displaced people
and the agencies supporting them may be provided by needs
assessments undertaken by or on behalf on operational agencies
supporting refugees and IDPs. Needs assessments not only inform
humanitarian partners but can inform those considering the data
needs of those supporting the displaced. The UNHCR Needs Assessment
Handbook provides guidance on their conduct (see also Phase 4
references <em>Phase Links and Examples of Training Manuals and Data
Collection Advice)</em>. These needs assessments were promoted by the
World Humanitarian Summit in 2016 and established "commitments for
aid organizations and donors to work together efficiently,
transparently, and harmoniously in order to better deliver
protection and assistance to the millions of people facing emergency
needs. One of these commitments calls for the improvement of needs
assessments, notably by:</p>

(ADAPT)</a><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> for NSOs to adapt
their data production processes to meet the data needs of users. It
is a consultative tool, which brings data stakeholders together to
identify data gaps, and define requirements within an established
monitoring indicator framework such as the UN Sustainable

IDP statistics. Further details and an explanation of this tool can
be found in PART III of the document (paragraph 739). Based on the
information provided, the ADAPT tool can produce two main reports on
the status of refugee and IDP statistics and identifies any data
gaps at national level. The first report is able to summarise the
status of refugee and IDP statistics in respect of the relevant
national requirements, which could be based on the IRRS or IRIS
tabulation indicator frameworks, or a national defined requirement.
The second report presents the status of refugee and IDP statistics
as a general domain of statistical production, considering all
indicators that require a relevant disaggregation variable.</p></li>

<ol start="31" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>National collaboration platforms, for example targeted workshops or
thematic conferences, and regional fora can be an opportunity to
engage with the identified strategic stakeholders and promote the
need for refugee and IDP statistics. Connecting the topics with
policy priorities at international and national levels can attract
the attendance of high-level political representatives and help to
gain government support.</p></li>
<li><p>Many countries are mandated by their statistics law to set out a
statistical work programme, an example of this is Turkstat whose
Official Statistics Programme is based on the Statistics Law of
Turkey No 5429. Many other countries have statistical development
plans such as the NSDS described below.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://nsdsguidelines.paris21.org/node/717">National Strategies for the Development of Statistics
(NSDSs)</a> provide a
framework for structuring support and developing statistical
capacity in the national statistical system. These multi-annual
strategies aim at mainstreaming sectors into the national
statistical system (NSS), engaging with other data producers and
coordinating the entire NSS, responding to data challenges, and
building statistical capacity across the “the statistical value
chain” (PARIS21, 2018). An NSDS can be an integral part of national
ownership over statistical development, and secure funding at
national and international level.</p></li>
<li><p>The implementation of refugee and IDP statistics in these
statistical development plans, which cover all parts of official
statistics, can be useful for mainstreaming these statistics into a
wider national planning process and improving cooperation with the
data producers involved. This is particularly important with
displacement statistics as data is likely to be held by many
agencies including non-traditional sources and the humanitarian
sector.</p></li>
<li><p>The NSDS should be firmly linked to national development plans and
involve several different sectors. Refugee and IDP statistics could
be considered a sector. The identification of targeted sectors
varies from country to country depending on national priorities and
administrative structures. Usually, sectoral strategies correspond
to line ministries, government departments or agencies with separate
and well-defined areas of concern, mandate and budget. However, most
countries do not have a corresponding government ministry or agency
responsible for monitoring forced migration or displacement, and the
level political sensitivity within these domains remains at a high
level.</p></li>
<li><p>As part of the NSDS process, making the case for developing a
sectoral strategy for refugee and IDP statistics is important.
Traditionally in the NSDS process, technical committees are in
charge of defining sectoral statistical needs, and the number of
sectors involved is often constrained. Depending on its strategic
importance to government, refugee and IDP statistics could face
challenges in being “recognised” as a sectoral statistical area
within the NSDS process and may require specific advocacy and the
allocation of a lead government Ministry, Department or Agency.</p></li>
<li><p>Depending on whether the country has developed a NSDS or not, the
mid-term evaluation or a new phase of the NSDS can be the right
moment for integrating a new sectoral strategy related to refugee
and IDP statistics. Integration of refugee and IDP statistics into
the NSDS should occur at all stages of the design and implementation
phases. The process of developing a sectoral strategy for refugee
and IDP statistics involves the following steps:</p></li>
</ol>
<div id="establishing-a-sector-statistics-committee-for-displacement-statistics" class="section level3 ListParagraph">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.1</span> Establishing a Sector Statistics Committee for Displacement Statistics</h3>
<ol start="38" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Sector Statistics Committees (SSC) are responsible for defining and
confirming the statistical needs for sectors. The Refugee and IDP
Statistics Committee should be constituted by those leading of the
sector at the request of the NSO, and a sector Coordinator should be
designated. A large number of departments, ministries and agencies
could be involved, including migration authorities, social
development ministries, urban planning authorities, rural
development authorities, and the humanitarian sector. Experience
shows that five active members are the ideal number for the
committee, but the Sector Statistics Committee should involve actors
from the wider data ecosystem and goes beyond the traditional
boundaries of the NSS, to humanitarian agencies including UNHCR and
OCHA.</p></li>
<li><p>The responsibilities of a potential Refugee and IDP Statistics
Committee would be similar to those of other sectors, including: a)
proposing a vision for refugee and IDP statistics for approval, b)
prioritising statistical activities over the lifespan of the
Sectoral Strategy for the Development of Statistics, c) identifying
major agencies currently collecting relevant statistics for refugees
and IDPs, d) preparing an inventory of existent current data systems
in existence operated by stakeholders, e) identifying major data
needs related to the sector, f) developing strategic actions,
including organisational and HR development, IT strategy,
dissemination policy and other areas.</p></li>
<li><p>The role of the NSO is important for statistics coordination and to
ensure that the potential data sources relevant for refugee and
displacement statistics are able to be used, and that data
confidentiality is adequately protected under the relevant
statistics law.</p></li>
<li><p>The sector statistics design team should consist of staff from
several ministries (e.g. Interior and External Relations Ministries,
Migration agency) to ensure commitment and assurance of staff time
through a more formal process, including memoranda of understanding
between the agencies and participating ministries. As NSSs are not
always able to capture forced migration and displacement within
officially produced data sources, data may be needed from
non-traditional data producing institutions, such as civil society
and humanitarian agencies.</p></li>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.2</span> Using operational data from humanitarian agencies for official statistics</h3>
<ol start="42" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Where there is insufficient data from government sources for
statistical purposes, operational data from humanitarian agencies
present a possible resource for establishing or augmenting a new
statistical series for refugee and IDP statistics. Operational data
are produced during regular activities of humanitarian agencies are
intended for internal use in planning operations only and do not
usually meet the standards set for official statistics, before use
they should be carefully assessed using a national or international
statistical data (e.g. UN Statistics <em>Quality Assurance Framework
quality assessment tool).</em></p></li>
<li><p>The quality of any operational data identified for use in a new
statistical series should be assessed focusing on standardisation,
coverage, accuracy and confidentiality. Ultimately, the statistical
authority (e.g. NSO, line ministry, specialised statistical unit
within NSS) in charge will determine the usefulness of operational
data as input for the new statistical series after assessing crucial
quality issues and negotiating data sharing agreements (see IRRS,
Chapter 6 pp 136-140).</p></li>
<li><p>One source of operational data is the IASC Common Operational
Datasets, are developed and endorsed by the Inter-agency Standing
Committee (IASC) and disseminated by OCHA. These are Common
Operational Data sets (CODs) and fundamental operational datasets
(FODs) used in humanitarian emergencies to support technical
standards, improve the quality of data, and strengthen
interoperability. In the IASC Common Operational Datasets there are
three levels of accountability: Guardian, Sponsor and Source. For
more information see the <a href="https://fscluster.org/sites/default/files/documents/IASC_Guidelines_on_Common_Operational_Datasets_in_Disaster_Preparedness_and_Response_1_Nov._2010%5B1%5D.pdf">IASC Guidelines on Common Operational
Datasets in Disaster Preparedness and
Response</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>The Protection Information Management for Quality Protection
Outcomes (PIM) Initiative<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> is a collaborative project, bringing
together UN, NGO, and other protection and IM partners working to
respond to protection needs in situations of displacement. The
objective of PIM is to provide quality data and information on
people in displacement situations in a safe, reliable, and
meaningful way. Data on refugees and IDPs can be extremely sensitive
and confidentiality and data protection are of paramount importance.
Data collection should be consistent with national legislation on
data protection and international obligations related to privacy.
Data protection considerations may limit the access of statisticians
to information in administrative systems, unless national laws
establish the right of access to administrative data for statistical
purposes. This project identifies three different roles for the use
of PIM data;</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Guardian:</strong> OCHA is the “Guardian” of the agreed upon datasets
and will facilitate the distribution of the “best” available
common operational and fundamental datasets in emergencies while
managing forums for updates and distribution communication. If
OCHA is unable to provide this service in a specific country, a
suitable substitute Guardian should be identified by
Humanitarian Country Teams or equivalent decision-making body
during contingency planning. Quality assurance for compliance
with minimum format and data characteristics in datasets will be
conducted by OCHA, or the substitute Guardian, prior to
distribution. This will include assigning a common GLIDE number
to be associated with the dataset after the onset of a natural
disaster<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sponsor:</strong> Each dataset has a designated “Sponsor” who is
responsible for identifying and liaising with relevant “Sources”
to analyse, collate, clean and achieve consensus around a
specific operational dataset If possible dataset Sponsors will
proactively identify and collate information prior to
emergencies in the data preparedness phase in support of the
contingency planning process. If this is not possible, Sponsors
will be identified in relation to their specific dataset early
in the emergency and will assume responsibilities related to
their thematic dataset. OCHA will maintain lists of dataset
Sponsors at the country and global levels and coordinate between
data Sponsors.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Source:</strong> Each dataset will have designated source(s) or
owner(s), such as: national authority/agency, Cluster, NGO, UN
agency, International Organization, International Red Cross/Red
Crescent that agrees to be fully responsible for the
development, maintenance and metadata associated with a dataset
and control distribution restrictions.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>In many countries where governments have limited capacity to
register refugees, the UNHCR collects administrative data on asylum
seekers and refugees on behalf of governments. Part III of this
manual includes an example of the data sharing Agreement on the
Transfer of Personal Data of Refugees and Asylum-seekers to
governments under certain conditions (see Part III <em>UNHCR Agreements
and Memoranda of</em> <em>Understand</em>ing). They acknowledge the importance
of registration as a protection tool and expect States to take
responsibility for registration as quickly as possible. The sharing
of data needs to be "<em>subject to the data protection safeguards as
contained in UNHCR’s Policy on the Protection of Persons of
Concern</em><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><em>".</em> The agreement allows for the <em>’</em>compiling
statistical data’ among the allowable purposes for personal data
transfer. Data may not be transferred to a third party except with
the prior written authorisation of UNHCR and/or the consent of the
data subject (the refugee or displaced person). Any third party must
conform with the conditions set out in the UNHCR data sharing
agreement. In the case of refugees, the data may not be shared with
the refugee’s country of origin, except under the circumstances of
voluntary repatriation under the auspices of UNHCR with the consent
of the individual refugee.</p></li>
<li><p>The minimum set of indicators identified in the IRRS and IRIS
recommendations should be considered as the core statistics to
monitor internal and international displacement and for reporting to
the global statistical system. However, it is recognised that most
countries will not reach this minimum initially, and that time will
be needed to build the capacity to produce these.</p></li>

<li><p>An internationally agreed refugee and related persons classification
was agreed in the IRRS 2018 (see Chapter 3) and a similar
classification for IDPs is set out in IRIS 2020 (see Chapter 3).
When referring to the refugee population within a given country, the
IRRS include persons who are “primarily classified in legal terms by
their claim to refugee status, or their descent from those with or
seeking international protection” (IRRS, 2018). There are three
major categories; a) Persons in need of international protection
which includes refugees, asylum seekers and others granted temporary
or subsidiary forms of protection; b) Persons with a refugee
background which includes naturalized former refugees, the children
and other family members of refugees, and c) Persons returned from
abroad after seeking international protection. (see IRRS Figure 3.1
page 30).</p></li>
<li><p>For IDPs and related populations there are four major categories; a)
Persons who have displacement-related protection needs (subdivided
into IDPs in locations of displacement, IDPs in location of return,
and IDPs in other settlement locations); b) IDP-related populations
who are the children born after displacement to at least one IDP
parent; c) Other non-displaced family members of IDPs; and d) Those
who have overcome key displacement-related vulnerabilities. (See
IRIS Figure 3.1 page 26).</p></li>
<li><p>From the point of view of the statistics users, nationally and
internationally, classificatory differences between national laws
and international recommendations may be identified. These
differences may reflect the specific needs of data users. If the
concepts do not align, the stakeholder should agree on a process to
approach conformity, and any remaining differences need to clearly
be identified in the accompanying metadata.</p>
<p>Classificatory differences mainly may arise due to differences in
national legislation and it may be required to add the reasons for
granting asylum. The reference metadata for a new statistical series
on refugee statistics should pay special attention to describing and
defining these differences to achieve international comparability of
refugee statistics. The structure of the reference metadata should
follow established statistical standards, such as Statistical Data
and Metadata eXchange (SDMX)<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a>.</p></li>

<ol start="53" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The production of refugee and IDP statistics often requires the
combination of data from several data producers within the national
statistical system, including line ministries, government
departments and agencies, and civil society. As national statistical
systems differ in their level of centralization, the effort needed
to foster consultation and collaboration between statistical
producers varies accordingly. Therefore, establishing a statistical
programme of work, developed jointly by the statistical producers,
requires an initial mapping of strategic stakeholders to be
consulted in the consultation for and the confirmation of the
business case.</p></li>
<li><p>Accessing data produced by the agencies responsible for displaced
people for statistical use can be problematic. There are a number of
reasons why data sharing between agencies for statistical purposes
can be difficult. These involve legal restrictions and issues of
trust between officials. While the statistics law is usually clear
about data confidentiality and the uses to which data can be put,
the agency collecting the data will also have its own laws and
regulations which may prohibit data sharing, and the issue becomes
one of legal precedence. The situation in the European Statistical
System as at 2015-2017 is set out below in <em>Table 1.2: National
Legal Framework - Clarity and coverage of legislation; restrictions
and limitations. (European Statistical System).</em></p></li>

laid down in the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:087:0164:0173:En:PDF">Regulation (EC)
223/2009</a>.
In this regulation <em>Article 24, Access to administrative records</em>
states;</p>
<p><em>“In order to reduce the burden on respondents, the NSIs and other
national authorities and the Commission (Eurostat) shall have access
to administrative data sources, from within their respective public
administrative system, to the extent that these data are necessary
for the development, production and dissemination of European
statistics.” </em></p></li>
<li><p>The <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/ess/about-us/ess-vision-2020">ESS Vision
2020</a> highlights
the importance of cooperation with stakeholders and of developing
strategic alliances with private and public partners (key area
"identifying user needs and cooperation with stakeholders"). A
workshop was organised in 2016 in order to allow the National
Statistical Institutes to identify and share best practices on
cooperating with the owners of administrative sources in order to
access to administrative data sources (<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cros/content/2016-workshop-access-administrative-sources_en">Workshop on Access to
Administrative Data
Sources</a>,
Brussels, 13-14 September 2016). Between 2015 and 2017, information
was collected on the obstacles that the NSOs still face in accessing
administrative data and how they have managed to overcome some of
the difficulties. On this basis, two reports were finalised in 2018:</p>

<li><p><em>The Turkey Case Study</em> cites the ability of Turkstat to access
administrative data collected under the <em>Foreigners and
International Protection law</em> by the Ministry of the Interior,
Director General of Migration Management (see Part II Case
Studies Turkey) under its legally mandated 5-year statistical
planning cycle (see paragraph 637 for reference to Law mandating
statistical planning). The Statistics Law of Turkey No 5429 also
mandates Turkstat for determining the basic principles and
standards for national registration systems, and for supporting
and monitoring the organisations involved in the statistical
production process.</p></li>

to increase the scope and coverage of a statistical series, the
legal constrains are particularly important. Readers should see also

which discusses data availability at length in respect of data
integration.</p></li>
