<p>’“n this phase, statistical outputs are produced, examined in detail and
made ready for dissemination. It includes preparing statistical content
(including commentary, technical notes, etc.), and ensuring outputs are
"fit for purpose" prior to dissemination to customers. This phase also
includes the sub-processes and activities that enable statistical
analysts to understand the statistics produced. For statistical outputs
produced regularly, this phase occurs in every iteration. The
"Analyse" phase and sub-processes are generic for all statistical
outputs, regardless of how the data were sourced<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a>”. (UNECE, 2013)</p>

the analysis required to produce the outputs specified in Phase 2.1

<pre><code>1.  Basic tabulations - estimates of counts and proportions of

2.  Basic indicators (statistics, proportions and estimates)

<li><p>Taking point iv, the more complex analysis, the different

They include linkages to SDGs and form part of the reporting of the

<h3><span class="header-section-number">7.1.1</span> Basic tabulations - estimates of counts and proportions of stocks and flows</h3>
<ol start="402" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Phase 2 Design defines stocks and flows. A stock corresponds to an
already-defined category of individuals and refers to a set of
characteristics. A stock refers to the total number of individuals
who have a specific set of characteristics, at a specific moment in
time. These characteristics, put together, define the status of
these individuals.</p></li>
<li><p>For example, IDPs have a specific set of characteristics, which
make them fit into this category. This is mainly the forced nature
of their displacement, its origin being the habitual place of
residence of the concerned persons or groups, the movement remaining
within internationally recognised borders and the individuals having
not yet found a durable solution to their displacement.</p></li>
<li><p>In contrast a refugee has been forcibly displaced by reason of a
well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion,
nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political
opinion and is <em>“outside the country of his or her nationality, has
crossed an internationally recognised border, and is unable to,
owing to such a fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the
protection of that country”</em><a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> in need of international
protection. The statistical categories recommended go beyond these
definitions, in order to classify those with a refugee or IDP
background and second-generation populations for statistical
analysis (see relevant Chapters 3 in both IRRS, 2018 and IRIS,
2020).</p></li>
<li><p>Flows affect this stock over time, either by making it increase
(“in-flows”) or decrease (“out-flows”). This in-flow corresponds to
the number of individuals who acquire the characteristics of those
in scope of the stock during a specified time period. For out-flows,
it is the number of people who cease to be refugees or IDPs, e.g. by
changes in status, death, birth or out-migration.</p></li>
<li><p>There can also be in-flows and out-flows between the sub-stocks,
for example an asylum seeker who is granted refugee status is an
outflow from the sub-stock of ‘Asylum seekers’, and an inflow into
‘Persons with determined status’ (see IRRS, Figure 3.1). Therefore,
there can be several stocks and flows, corresponding to the various
classifications of populations being analysed. If the stocks are
interconnected, i.e. if a person or group move from one status to
another, the flows can also be interconnected; the out-flow from one
stock can be the in-flow into another stock.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The basic tabulations of refugee and refugee related stocks and
flows</strong> are set out in Phase 2 <em>2.1.1. Refugee statistics outputs</em>
in Table 2.1 Basic Refugee Stock Tabulations and Table 2.2 Basic
Refugee Flow Tabulations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The basic tabulations of IDPs and IDP related stocks and flows</strong>
are set out in Phase 2 <em>2.1.2. IDP statistics outputs</em> in Table
2.5 - Basic IDP Flow Tabulations, which covers both outflows and
inflows to the IDP and IDP-related stock, and Table 2.6 IDP Stock
Tabulations.</p></li>
<li><p>These stock tabulations include both i) IDPs, ii) IDP-Related and
iii). Those Who Have Overcome Key Displacement-Related
Vulnerabilities. Some analysis will be required to identify the
stock of the third category, and to estimate the flows of those who
have been removed from the IDP stock because they <em>have overcome key
displacement-related vulnerabilities.</em> Analysis will be needed to
derive the variable in the databases which enables the analyst to
identify those who have overcome those vulnerabilities, and to
remove them statistically from stock. This is identification process
described below in <em>section</em> <em>0,</em> but it should be noted that the
full methodology for determining IDPs to be removed from stock is in
its early stages. A more developed methodology will be added to
future editions of this manual.</p></li>

<li><p>‘In light of the mass influx between 2014 and 2016, the Federal
Statistical Office of Germany explored the feasibility of
complementing existing statistics on the inflow of refugees derived
from asylum applications with information on the stock of foreigners
living in Germany for humanitarian reasons. The concept was designed
to take a comprehensive approach by not only including foreigners
with a granted protection status but also foreigners with an asylum
application still pending as well as foreigners who still remain in
Germany after having been refused protection. Thereby, the approach
follows the International Recommendations for Refugee Statistics
that were recently adopted by the United Nations Statistical
Commission. The concept relies on residence permit data obtained
from the Central Register of Foreigners. This data allows
identifying foreigners currently applying as well as foreigners
having been granted or denied humanitarian protection. At the end of
2016, about 1.6 million foreigners were identified as seeking
humanitarian protection in Germany. That represents about 2 percent
of the resident population and about 16 % of all resident
foreigners. During to the recent surge in humanitarian immigration
to Germany between 2014 and 2016, the stock has more than

<div id="irrs-recommendations" class="section level4 ListParagraph">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">7.1.4.1</span> IRRS Recommendations</h4>
<ol start="429" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>From a legal perspective, durable solutions for refugees occur when
refugees can once again enjoy the protection of a state, either
through voluntary repatriation to their country of origin,
integration in their host country, or resettlement to a third
country. However, given the protracted nature of many conflicts,
repatriation is not an immediate prospect for most refugees, and
resettlement and naturalization are solutions for only a small
minority. In reality, the majority of refugees aspire to, or enjoy,
de facto integration in their host countries. Rather than a one-off
event, the integration of refugees involves an incremental process.
The IRRS focuses on the satisfaction of refugees’ immediate and
ongoing needs, their access to rights and on their integration.
Living conditions can serve as a proxy for the satisfaction of these
needs, and as data about peoples’ living conditions have been
routinely collected across the world for over 25 years, the results
for the general population are already widely available. The
satisfaction of basic needs, and the acquisition of rights is the
first step in the integration of refugees.</p></li>
<li><p>Refugees have particular challenges compared to general migrants.
Due to the forced nature of their migration and the traumatic
experiences frequently associated with it, they often suffer from
psychological distress and disabilities. Moreover, unlike labour
migrants who tend to settle where their skills can be used more
productively than in their home country, refugees may settle in
areas with limited or no employment or other livelihood
opportunities.</p></li>
<li><p>The IRRS presents recommendations for indicators that can be used
to measure satisfaction of needs, access to rights and the
integration of refugees with their host country or original country
communities. The recommendations are grouped into three levels of
indicators: priority, second level, and third level indicators.
Table 5.1 of the IRRS presents the proposed indicators organized by
the dimension of need and integration that it measures, specifically
the following: (a) legal; (b) civil-political; (c) demographic and
migration; (d) education; (e) economic; (f) social inclusion;
and (g) health. In addition, several core classificatory variables
are also recommended for the production of comparative analyses.</p></li>
<li><p>These classificatory variables are cross-referenced to those
tabulations recommended earlier in Phase 2.1. These include country
of birth, age, sex, reason for migrating, legal status, citizenship
and length of time in the host country. Length of residence in the
host country is especially important for statistics on integration
because integration is a temporal process that begins when the
refugee arrives in the host country. The pace of integration is
usually different for refugee and refugee related groups compared
with general migrants.</p></li>
<li><p>The characteristics of age and sex are used to disaggregate
indicators of refugee living conditions and integration. For
instance, using the sex variable to look at the difference in
employment status between male and female refugees can highlight
gender differences for that indicator. Classificatory variables are
described in detail <em>in</em> <em>Table 2.9: Variables for refugee
statistics</em>. As far as possible the proposed indicators correspond
with those of the SDGs. Where they correspond, the equivalent SDG
indicators have been noted in IRRS Table 5.1, the correspondence is
often not direct. Guidance is given on the composition of the
proposed indicators. Additionally, metadata for the SDG indicators
are published by the United Nations Statistical Division on their
website.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> The last column of Table 5.1 gives the closest SDG
indicator equivalence, it is not proposed that all these indicators

    thus, whether or not persons with displacement-related
    protection needs and vulnerabilities can be taken out of the
    total IDP stock.</code></pre>
<ol start="437" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>For the purpose of statistically measuring durable solutions
progress, displacement-related vulnerabilities, sub-criteria were
specified for each of the eight IASC criteria as is shown in Table
6.3 Criteria and sub-criteria included in the composite measure
(IRIS, Table 4.3) below. The first four criteria of the IASC
Framework are relevant in all contexts and should therefore always
be included. The last four should be considered and can be included
if deemed relevant for the specific displacement context. Therefore,
all eight criteria are included in recommendations to measure
progress towards durable solutions (see IRIS, paragraph 146).
Regarding the development of the composite measure for overcoming
key displacement-related vulnerabilities, a smaller set of criteria
are chosen, including the four deemed to always be relevant in
displacement contexts. Given the prevalence of challenges linked to
lack of documentation in many displacement settings, it is also
recommended to include the fifth criteria on access to personal and
other documentation in any statistical measure that can result in
taking IDPs out of the stock. This measure therefore prioritises
five of the eight criteria (see IRIS, paragraph 164).</p></li>
<li><p>For each sub-criterion, there are many different indicators which
can be chosen, although a final list has not yet been agreed. The
indicators selected in each national context should, as far as
possible, be aligned with already tested and standardized
indicators. The Durable Solutions indicator library provides a
thorough overview of potential options (see Durable Solutions
Library<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a>). Where relevant, they should also mirror the SDG
indicators recommended to be disaggregated by different categories
of displacement. Indicators selected should be carefully chosen to
ensure they are relevant for all three sub-stocks of the displaced
population: IDPs in locations of displacement, IDPs in locations of
return and IDPs in other settlement locations.</p></li>
<li><p>A preliminary proposal of indicators for the sub-criteria has been
developed by the EGRIS’ IDP subgroup (see IRIS for discussion of
indicator selection), taking into consideration the above listed
aspects. The aim of this work was to provide a short, manageable
list of one or two indicators per sub-criteria. However, given the
limited availability of data, particularly for the sub-criteria
which experts determined to be displacement-specific, it is too
preliminary to recommend a final list of indicators for each
sub-criterion at this stage. Further testing is required to detail
out this proposal. As this work progresses, information will be
added to future editions of the Compilers’ Manual, including
implications for target setting based on different types of
indicators (see IRIS, paragraph 166). Once finalized an updated
version of these Recommendations could be considered. In the
meantime, countries and international organisations should use the
durable solutions indicator library as a reference and starting
point for indicator selection and should as far as possible follow
principles described (see IRIS, paragraphs 135-137).</p></li>

<ol start="444" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The Government of Sudan and the international community are working
together to jointly support durable solutions for Darfur’s
internally displaced people. The commitment is rooted in the Doha
Document for Peace in Darfur (DDPD) from 2011, signed by the
Government of Sudan, other major parties to the conflict and the
international community, and which sets out the framework for peace
in Darfur.</p></li>
<li><p>A durable solutions process was piloted in El Fasher in North
Darfur. To reach durable solutions and end displacement, long-term
planning based on agreed and jointly-owned comprehensive data is
needed. To establish an agreed evidence base, a collaborative
profiling approach was adopted that brought actors together to
ensure trust and ownership of the results of the profiling exercise.
An important aspect of this durable solutions profiling is that it
places IDPs centre-stage alongside the two other major
stakeholders—the Government of Sudan and the international
community—permitting the profiling results and recommendations to
be owned and signed off by all parties.</p></li>
<li><p>The durable solutions profiling exercise in El Fasher specifically
aims to:</p></li>
</ol>
<pre><code>28. Provide a comprehensive profile of IDPs residing in Abu Shouk
    and El Salaam IDP camps.

29. Develop a better understanding of IDPs&#39; vulnerabilities, coping
    mechanisms, capacities and provide insight into IDPs&#39;
    perceptions and their future settlement intentions.

30. Provide a jointly agreed upon data set to help inform durable
    solutions programming responses.

31. Pilot a profiling exercise of displacement and joint durable
    solutions planning that could be replicated in other Sudan
    contexts with displaced populations.</code></pre>
<ol start="447" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The profiling exercise adopted the Inter-Agency Standing Committee
(IASC) Framework on Durable Solutions for Internally Displaced
Persons as an analytical framework. The profiling was designed to
take into account the displaced persons’ perspectives on durable
solutions including preferred settlement options and places a strong
emphasis on understanding the rationale behind these preferences. It
is also concerned with understanding the progress IDP communities
have made across the IASC durable solutions criteria and applied an
area-based comparative approach.</p></li>
<li><p>This comparative analysis was used to understand whether hardships
are a result of IDPs’ displacement or development challenges shared
with non-displaced communities in El Fasher. Finally, it included a
macrolevel urban analysis. The profiling exercise used mixed
methods: mapping and enumeration, a household survey, and key
informant interviews. The profiling applied a gender lens and
questions for further analysis, which were included in the report
narrative when significant gender related differences were
identified. The repost gives details of the indicators used as part
of the profiling exercise. Link

<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.2</span> Validate outputs</h2>
<ol start="460" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>This sub-process is where statisticians validate the quality of the
outputs produced, in accordance with a general quality framework
(developed in Phase 2) and with expectations based on local
knowledge. This sub-process also includes activities involved with
the gathering of intelligence, with the cumulative effect of
building up a body of knowledge about a specific statistical domain.
This knowledge is then applied to the current collection, in the
current environment, to identify any divergence from expectations
and to allow informed analyses. Validation activities can include
checking the population coverage in the sample group and looking for
content errors.</p></li>
<li><p>An example is Population Census coverage that can involve two or
three major problems such as under representation, over
representation, and selection bias in the study design. The most
common problem is under-representation of the population in the
sample group or due to selection bias in the research design.
Generally, an aggregate undercount of 3 to 6% is considered
acceptable, but some population groups tend to be disproportionately
affected, e.g. very young children, young mobile men and
undocumented migrants. Over-coverage also happens, especially if
local authorities, with an interest in exaggerating their
populations, are able to influence the data collection.</p></li>
<li><p>Content errors might involve non-response bias and response bias
for some of the key variables in the data collection phase.
Individual data are often provided by an informant who is either the
head of household or another responsible adult household member.
These proxy respondents may not know all the details regarding each
member of the households, or sometimes may not want to share the
facts. The household members themselves may be unsure or
misunderstand the question. They may even hide or distort
information on purpose (see also under-reporting of
consumption<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a>. As a result, data quality may be poor, despite
excellent coverage. Therefore, it is necessary to detect those
errors in the in the analysis phase and select the right analysis
techniques to eradicate or minimise the content error.</p></li>
<li><p>There are several methods for quality assessment. Content errors
can often be detected through internal consistency analysis by
crosschecking the data across different datasets. Furthermore, the
analyst can resort to the following mechanisms to validate the
findings:</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>Comparing the statistics with previous cycles (if applicable and
&gt; available),</p></li>
<li><p>Checking that the associated metadata and paradata (process
&gt; metadata) are present and in line with the expectations,</p></li>
<li><p>Checking the statistics for consistency against other relevant data
&gt; (both internal and external), comparing with other national
&gt; sources, operational and global data,</p></li>
<li><p>Investigating inconsistencies in the statistics,</p></li>
<li><p>Agreeing with the accepted threshold level in applying the quality
&gt; standards and validation processes</p></li>
<li><p>Performing macro editing, and</p></li>
<li><p>Validating the statistics against expectations and domain
&gt; intelligence.</p></li>
</ul>
<ol start="464" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The main criteria are: is the data understandable, usable for
analysis and fit for purpose, particularly the purpose that was
articulated in the Design phase. Does it respond to the questions
that were set initially?</p></li>
<li><p>Comparators are important, either from another dataset relating to
a similar group or population, or to the same group/population
across different time periods. Particularly important is coherence
when comparing datasets are those obtained via different methods
(e.g. surveys versus registration). Although the figures obtained
via different methods will not always match, they need to show clear
relative trends, to allow comparability. The availability of good
metadata for both datasets will enable judgments to be made about
the reasons for differences and for a judgement to be made about the
quality of the data.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong><em>analytical framework</em></strong> should include <strong><em>commentary and
notes</em></strong>, to allow proper understanding of how the data was obtained
and treated, in order to support the accessibility and credibility
of the results. This commentary should be accompanied by clear
explanatory metadata pertaining to how the data were collected,
processed and analysed (see Phase 7 on metadata)</p></li>
<li><p>Complement the estimates with <strong><em>contextual updates</em></strong>, to inform
the reader and to allow for better understanding of trends. If
numbers go up, does this correspond to greater coverage, or to an
increase in violence, attacks or incidence of disasters. Try to
explain what the likely correlates are.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Triangulation</em></strong>: use operational data for comparison,
particularly for flow data, as operational data is more likely to
capture micro-movements, spontaneous movements, short-term
displacements. It is necessary to make sure the trends match between
the various datasets without any major deviation. If the variation
between two stocks is not significant, but operational data
identifies a high number of smaller, shorter term movements (e.g. in
the case of preventative evacuations leading to quick returns, or
mass movements leading to cross border returns), then this should
allow official statistics to verify/correct their flow data.</p></li>
<li><p>Linking to cross border data, <strong><em>interoperability</em></strong>: if movements
lead to significant cross-border flight or returns, the datasets on
both sides of the border should correspond with each other to ensure
validity. Refugee data could be compared to third country nationals,
refugees, migrants in other countries, to validate estimates and
trends. Example: the stocks of IDPs in South Sudan only increase
marginally between two data collection periods; however, the number
of South Sudanese nationals in the Central African Republic increase
exponentially, then the likelihood is that people were displaced
over the border. Operational flow data from displacement event
should reflect that significant variation, even if the stocks do
not.</p></li>
<li><p>Even if variations in operational flow data from incidents do not
match variations in stocks, the differences between the different
stock types should be proportional. However, an increase in the
number of displacements does not mean that a similar same increase
will appear in stocks, as those displacements could relate to the
same people being displaced on multiple occasions. For example, if
the numbers of IDPs in an area decreases, the numbers corresponding
to that decrease should be reflected in another stock, e.g. there
are 10,000 less IDPs in Borno State in Nigeria, because there are
10,000 more Nigerian refugees in Cameroon.</p></li>

<li><p>“The State of Humanitarian Shelter and Settlements” report by
Global Shelter Cluster (GSC) report provided an in-depth review of
the evidence base of the shelter and settlements sector, and the

encountered when attempting to measure shelter adequacy is obtaining
accurate data across various contexts. This is due partly to the
multi-sectoral nature of the criteria, and the wide range of
environments in which humanitarian agencies work, as well as to
variations between shelter designs, materials and costs. In
addition, different adequacy indicators may sometimes conflict with
each other. Most shelter actors therefore agree that a

how datasets on different population types talk to each other, their
ability to share information on those populations, or even on
specific individuals, their characteristics and their needs. This
can enable possibilities for combining datasets to improve coverage
and quality (see section on <em>Data Source D: Integrated Data</em>). This
can also help prevent duplication of data. A data protection policy
should be in place from the start, and Phase 2D discusses the <em>a.
Legal environment and data protection legislation</em> and the other
capacity requirements for this.</p></li>
<li><p>Data integration may be possible where the data being collected by
various government databases relates to individuals, groups or
populations who are registered in one or more government databases.
Inter-agency data sharing protocols can enable this and also help to
prevent duplication. As the various service needs of the concerned
populations are likely to be addressed by different entities within
the government (or even by entities outside of it), data sharing
between those entities will ensure greater capacity for analysis.</p></li>
<li><p>There are technical computer languages that allow data sharing more
effectively, such as tagging, e.g. using HXL, allowing the data
outputs to be identifiable by various data sharing platforms, and
for the various elements of the datasets to be identified and shared
individually as well.</p></li>
<li><p>For an example of how anonymisation is done by different
governments and the decision rules that are applied to enforce it.

higher levels of security, IRRS, Box 6.4.</p></li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.5</span> Finalise outputs</h2>
<ol start="483" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Final outputs and datasets must come packaged with all the fields
or variables fully explained, with good metadata. The metadata
should explain anything that might have affected the accuracy or
quality of the data. Data treatments, weighting and any other
transformations such as derived variables should be fully documented
and made available to users.</p></li>
<li><p>It is crucial to account for any caveats/limitations that may
affect the data and therefore prevent analysis, as well as
comparability. An example of a caveat would be to specify the
geographical coverage of the datasets. This should include coverage
problems which have resulted from difficulty of access in particular
locations. All caveats must be detailed: specific to each collection
method, highlighting any potential difference in the collection
exercises at different times, obstacles met preventing the data to
be collected according to the parameters set in the Design phase,
and include calculations of the sampling errors which apply to key
estimates.</p></li>
<li><p>The outputs should also specify what quality assurance and quality
control mechanisms were applied, and the findings of the quality
assessments should be made available to users.</p></li>
