<p>“This phase describes the development and design activities, and any
associated practical research work needed to define the statistical
outputs, concepts, methodologies, collection instruments and
operational processes. It includes all the design elements needed to
define or refine the statistical products or services identified in
the business case. This phase specifies all relevant metadata, ready
for use later in the statistical business process, as well as quality
assurance procedures. For statistical outputs produced on a regular
basis, this phase usually occurs for the first iteration, and whenever
improvement actions are identified in the Evaluate phase of a previous
iteration.” (UNECE, 2013)</p>

complex to estimate than the flows of refugees, as the ending of IDP
status is not legally defined in international law as is the case

<ol start="75" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Most of the variables to be used are common to other areas of social
statistics, but several are unique to refugee statistics. The
classifications of asylum seekers, refugees and those with a refugee
background ae unique, and more detail can be found in IRRS
Chapter 3. These variables required are set out in below in <em>Table
2.9: Variables for refugee statistics</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Variable xi in the table, <em>Legal residential/international
protection status as applicable to the national context</em> in the
table refers to the persons legal status in respect of international
protection. The classification is set out in IRRS (2018) Figure 3.1
and reproduced here in <em>Table 2.10: Classification of legal
protection status of refugees and refugee related populations.</em></p></li>
<li><p>Another variable that is unique to displacement statistics is linked
to the legal concept of place or country of habitual residence. This
refers to the place or country where a person was usually resident
at the time they were displaced. This concept occurs in variable
viii listed below for refugee statistics and in IDP statistics.</p></li>
<li><p>The usual place or country of residence is where a person is living
now, and has been or intends to continue living for one year. The
habitual place of residence is the place or country from where the
person was displaced. IRIS (2020) Box 3.3 describes the differences.
The concepts are equally applicable to country and place of
residence. The concept is used in the <em>Bosnia and Herzegovina Case
Study</em> (see paragraph <em>537 onwards)</em> and captures the address before
the war and the current address in its Database of Displaced Persons
(DDPR). Georgia asks in its census “Where are you a refugee from”
(see paragraph 579).</p></li>

<ol start="79" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The list of variables for IDP statistics is very similar to those of
refugees but omits the international migration related questions and
includes the date of first and last displacement. The reason for
displacement is required in a more extensive form, and the type of
dwelling or habitation they are currently living in is also
required. In order to identify the IDP-related population the IDP
status of parents is also required.</li>
</ol>
<p>Table 2.11: Variables for IDP statistics</p>
<ol start="80" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Variables vii and viii are used to assess whether or not individuals
have returned to their habitual place of residence. This return
enables the IDP to be classified according to the three sub-stocks
(see IRIS, 2020 Figure 3.1 - i. IDPs in locations of
displacement, ii. IDPs in locations of return, and iii. IDPs in
other settlement locations) and to be counted as flow within the
stock.</p></li>
<li><p>As a simple return does not mean that IDPs have overcome all their
displacement related vulnerabilities, additional variables will be
needed to assess the IDPs progress and to contribute to the
composite measure to assess overcoming key displacement-related
vulnerabilities. The <em>Criteria and sub-criteria included in the
Composite Measure of Overcoming Displacement-Related
Vulnerabilities</em> is explained in the IRIS Chapter 4 and is
illustrated in Figure 4.3 reproduced below. The same chapter
discusses the choice of the variables to be used, and future
progress on recommendations made will be included in future versions
of this Manual.</p></li>
<li><p>Therefore, in addition to classificatory variables described above,
a set of variables should be chosen to assess the IDPs progress
towards overcoming their displacement related vulnerabilities.
<em>Table 2.12: Criteria and sub-criteria included in the composite
measure of overcoming displacement-related vulnerabilities</em> lists
the criteria.</p></li>
<li><p>To make the assessment of the progress of the IDP and IDP-related
population a comparator population is needed, this may be the
general population or sub-national population in the vicinity of the
initial displacement who have not themselves suffered displacement.
These variables should also be available in the comparator
population where relevant to enable comparisons to be made.</p></li>

<li><p>For each sub-criterion, there are many different indicators which
can be chosen, although a final list has not yet been agreed. The
indicators selected in each national context should, as far as
possible, be aligned with already tested and standardized
indicators. The Durable Solutions indicator library<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> provides a
thorough overview of potential options (see IRIS,2020 paragraph
127-128). Where relevant, they should also mirror the SDG indicators
recommended to be disaggregated by different categories of
displacement. Indicators selected should be carefully chosen to
ensure they are relevant for all three sub-stocks of the displaced
population: IDPs in locations of displacement, IDPs in locations of
return and IDPs in other settlement locations.</p></li>
<li><p>For the purposes of statistical measurement, to make it as unbiased
and cost efficient as possible, the following aspects should be
taken into account when selecting the indicators:</p>
<ol start="6" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Commonly used: It is an advantage if the indicator in question
is collected for other purposes as well to facilitate population
group comparison and to incorporate displacement analysis into
existing larger data collection processes. SDG indicators are a
good example here as most surveys and censuses will cover a
number of these at least up until 2030.</p></li>
<li><p>Tested and evaluated. Linked to the previous point, it is also
an advantage to select indicators or questions which have been
tested and satisfy quality criteria. This is the case for most
of the indicators and related questions asked in standard
household surveys, for example on education, food security or
employment.</p></li>
<li><p>Covering the population in question: There are several potential
indicators which may be relevant in the context, but do not
cover all of the population in question.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>This manual discusses four types of data sources: A. Census of
Population and Housing, B. Sample Surveys, C. Administrative Data
and D. Integrated Data Sources. Each of these data sources is
described in turn, and subprocesses 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5 are separately
described for each of the sources where relevant.</p></li>
<li><p>The design of the data collection should at a minimum aim to collect
data to populate the variables described above in sub-phase 2.2.
Design variable descriptions. In many cases the data collection
exercise will need to identify both the refugee and related
populations, and the IDP and related populations. Compromises may
need to be made to keep the questioning to manageable proportions.</p></li>

<ol start="89" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The IRRS, 2018 includes a recommendation on identifying refugees in
the population census, by asking about the main reason for the
immigration to the country and allowing for an option on forced
displacement. If internal migration is also included in a census,
then there is the potential to screen for IDPs as well as refugees
by asking similar questions on the reason for internal moves within
a country. Typically, a census asks about a person’s location a year
ago, and in some cases 5 years ago. Where there have been large
displacements in a country the date selected often coincides with a
significant displacement event, as this not only helps people to
recall where they were on the date chosen improving accuracy, but
also helps to identify IDPs.</p></li>
<li><p>The IRIS, 2020 also make census recommendations. Recognising that
relying on internal migration questions in a census is likely to
lead to an under-estimation of IDP stocks because the last move of
an IDP is not always the most relevant one. The limitations are as
follows;</p>
<ol start="11" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Place of habitual residence will usually not be identified,</p></li>
<li><p>Those who have returned to their habitual place of residence
within the period specified by the census,</p></li>
<li><p>Those who within the period specified by the census have moved
one or several times after their initial displacement, and</p></li>
<li><p>Those who have moved within the same administrative area used in
census geographical classifications.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Ideally every census would ask questions about the reasons for both
internal and international migration and include a response on
forced displacement. This would capture IDPs, refugees, asylum
seekers, those under temporary protection and those returning to
their country of habitual residence. The reason should refer to the
main reason for the most recent move. The question should be asked
of all individuals, not just adults and also be asked to those
living in camps and other temporary accommodation. Camps are often
treated as institutional buildings and respondents are asked a brief
subset of questions which are unsuitable for identifying displaced
people.</p></li>

<li><p>In many censuses there are several questionnaire forms, there is
usually one form for a private household and another for
‘institutional establishments’. These institutions often comprise
schools, hospitals, hotels, workers camps and so on. They may also
be used to cover camps for IDPs or refugees. Institutional
questionnaires may not be suitable for camps for the displaced,
particularly where these are more than short term arrangements. As
the question content is often much shorter in the institutional
questionnaire than in the household questionnaire, the information
will be insufficient to provide for the requirements of users
interested in displaced people. Wherever possible the camps should
be enumerated using the questionnaires designed for private
households.</p></li>
<li><p>It may also be possible to distinguish the type of camp and to
record that on the questionnaire forms. The type of living quarter
as recommended by the UN/ECE manual is a single response question

this question makes it possible to distinguish between IDPs and

which cover many of the core variables required to screen the
population for Refugees (♥) and IDPs (♣), although several of the
items are non-core topics which are at the discretion of countries
to add. The reason for migration, both international and internal,
would need to include an answer category which includes the concept
of forced migration. The UNECE recommendation on the reason for
international migration is ’<em>admittance for humanitarian or
political reasons</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>The UNECE document also provides a definition of the population
group "<em>Population with a refugee background".</em> The definition of
this population group includes:</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>"(a) Persons who declared that their main reason for migration
international migration was ‘forced migration.’ Some examples of
categories that would qualify as ‘forced migration’ are; armed
conflict, situations of general violence, violations of human rights,
natural or human-made disasters.</p>
<p>(b)  Foreign-born persons who declared that their main reason for
migration was ‘Family’ and are members of the same family nucleus of a
person in group (a).</p>
<p>(c)  Native-born children members of the same family nucleus of the
parents and having both parents in group (a) or one parent in the group

as identified in the census, are, therefore, specifically defined as
those who are usually resident in a civil division at the</em> <em>census
reference time and who have previously been resident in another
civil division within the country</em>”. This is slightly problematic
for IDPs who need not cross an administrative boundary in order to
quality as an IDP (IRIS, 2020 paragraph 115). To capture these IDPs
who do not move administrative areas a direct question about
displacement may be required for all individuals (see above 49).</p></li>

members who were not themselves displaced are not treated as IDPs,

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.3.2</span> Hybrid census techniques</h3>
<ol start="102" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>A hybrid census produces population estimates for small areas or
for uniform, detailed grids in the absence of a traditional national
census. Hybrid censuses rely on complete counts of population within
small, defined areas, through ‘micro-census surveys’ selected across
an area. These data are collected relatively rapidly and at a
fraction of the cost of a full national census. Statistical models
are then used to link these micro-census data to spatial data with
full coverage to predict population numbers in the unsampled
locations. Population totals can also be produced for administrative
units or for the national level by aggregating these high-resolution
predictions.</p></li>
<li><p>This approach can never replace the data generated by a traditional
population and housing census, which provides full coverage of data
on individuals, families, households and communities. However, where
a traditional census cannot be fully executed in all locations of a
country due to insecurity or other concerns, then this hybrid
approach can produce population estimates for small areas in the
absence of traditional census data.</p></li>
<li><p>Population data for a sample of areas across the area or country
are needed as a primary input for a hybrid census. These data may
come from a partial census, a census-like population survey or a
specifically designed micro-census survey. Robust geo-referencing of
the geographical areas where population data has been acquired is
also a requirement.</p></li>
<li><p>The design must capture the range of population densities,
demographics and environmental dimensions that exist across the
area. Enumeration can be conducted within administrative units or
within other arbitrarily designed polygons, as long as the
population data is explicitly linked to the correct geographical
area. Global Positioning Systems (GPS) can be used to ensure
enumeration is occurring in the correct location, and the inclusion
of GPS technology in smart phones and tablet computers can integrate
navigation and the recording of geographical coordinates into
enumeration activities, minimising locational error and human
effort. Depending on the questions included in the micro-census,
disaggregation for certain population groups can be achieved.</p></li>
<li><p>There are several limitations to the approach:</p></li>
</ol>
<pre><code>20. Micro-census data must be collected with the same care and rigor
    as a full census.

21. Population data are highly political and contentious, affecting
    all per capita rate estimates, shifting political representation
    and changing claims to power or resources. Conflicts,
    environmental hazards, or large population displacements make it
    difficult to accurately collect information on the dynamic
    population, and misrepresenting populations at risk should be
    avoided.</code></pre>
<p>Box 2.2: Afghanistan hybrid census</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The last population census in Afghanistan was conducted in 1979 and a new census is not foreseen until after 2020.
To fill this gap, UNFPA, Flowminder/WorldPop and the Afghanistan National Statistical Office have worked together to develop an innovative methodology to estimate subnational population counts.
By combining survey, GIS and satellite data into a statistical model to predict numbers in areas where no population data were available, it was possible to generate high resolution maps of population estimates disaggregated by age and sex, together with uncertainty metrics. The data will be used to support decision making and the measurement of the 98 SDG indicators that require population data. The collaboration has also contributed to further strengthening capacities of the Central Statistics Office and other related government agencies to generate population estimates based on the integration of geospatial data and ground surveys.</p>

<li>In order to ensure coverage of refugee and IDP population in a
census it is essential to have an image of the places where the
people of interest, the refuges and/or IDPs are currently
concentrated as mapping exercises can become outdated very quickly
in times of displacement. A very useful method is to collect data
from mobile phones using call connection records. From there we can
have up to date information about sudden changes of population
density in small areas. With this method it is possible to have also
a picture for the size of the new refugee or IDP settlement which

<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.3.4.1</span> Quality Assessment – the Post Enumeration Survey</h4>
<ol start="108" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Assessing the quality of population and housing census data is an
integral part of the census operation. UNFPA advocates for more
countries to carry out some sort of quality assessment exercise. The
Post Enumeration Survey (PES) of a Population Census is a sample
survey that evaluates the results of the Census with regard to
potential underestimation or overestimation of the size of the
permanent population as well as to the capturing of the
characteristics of the population.</p></li>
<li><p>Of the 134 countries or territories responding to a UN Statistics
Division (UNSD) questionnaire on census implementation in the 2010
census round, 89 had conducted a PES to evaluate the coverage of the
census; among them 75% used the PES to evaluate content errors. In
Africa, Asia and South America, 78% of countries undertook a PES,
compared to only 40% of countries in Oceania. One third of the
countries implementing a PES used the results to adjust census
figures.</p></li>
<li><p>Any census Post Enumeration Survey should look at the coverage of
refugees and IDPs and the accuracy of data collected about them. To
do this it is essential to carry out the PES in refugee camps,
shelters, rented homes or any other institutional or other places
where refugees and IDPs may be staying. Special attention must be
paid for the demographic characteristics and the refugee status of
the persons concerned. This may need a special design component
within the PES</p></li>
<li><p>Such assessments need to consider two kinds of quality measures,
namely:</p></li>
</ol>
<pre><code>22. Census coverage: This is the percentage of actual
    population/households enumerated. The most common problem is
    under-coverage. Although with populations on the move
    over-coverage is also possible. Over-coverage also happens, if
    local authorities, with an interest in exaggerating their
    populations, are able to influence the data collection. An
    aggregate undercount of 3 to 6% is considered acceptable, but
    some population groups tend to be disproportionately affected,
    e.g. children under low age, young mobile men and undocumented
    migrants.

23. Content errors: This is the extent of incorrect answers for some
    key variables. Individual data are often provided by an
    informant (the head of household or other adult household
    member) who may not know all the details regarding each person.
    The household members themselves may be unsure or misunderstand
    the question. They may also hide or distort information on
    purpose. As a result, data quality may be poor, despite
    excellent coverage.</code></pre>
<ol start="112" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>There are several methods for quality assessment. Content errors
can often be detected through internal consistency analysis.
Inconsistencies (e.g. between children’s ages and educational
status, or young girls’ ages and number of children, etc.) indicate
poor data quality. But not all errors lead to inconsistencies.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="a.2.-pes-design" class="section level4 ListParagraph">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.3.4.2</span> PES Design</h4>
<ol start="113" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Depending on the design of the PES sample, the household
identification can be more or less rigorous. The following designs
can be considered:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>i.  The PES sample consists of census enumeration areas that are
    completely re-enumerated in the PES. This design requires
    sufficient cases to provide results for relevant sub-samples
    including displaced people). It is easier to administer than the
    other options and reduces the travel time taken by enumerators.
    There are several requirements for this kind of PES; the
    enumeration areas must be well defined, with explicit
    geographical boundaries, based on good census cartography;
    out-of-area enumeration in the census should be almost
    non-existent; and the interval between the census and the PES
    should be very short (1-3 months).

ii. The PES sample consists of a larger number of census enumeration
    areas in each of which a certain fraction of households is
    sampled.

iii. The PES sample contains no clusters, but simply re-enumerates
    every n-th household from a newly produced national household
    listing. This design is efficient from a sampling viewpoint, but
    it is difficult to administer.</code></pre>
<ol start="114" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>To apply designs ii) or iii) it is essential to use a rigorous
household identification system. In its absence, design i) is the
only viable option and even this may be challenging if the
conditions listed above are not satisfied.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="a.3.-pes-analysis" class="section level4 ListParagraph">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.3.4.3</span> PES Analysis</h4>
<ol start="115" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>A specific subject that requires planning and attention is how to
deal with any changes in the situation of the households, that could
be as a result of forced displacement. This displacement may have
occurred between the census and the PES, and may impact on the
household’s composition. Specific questions have to be included in
the PES that allow the detection of such changes, taking either the
census or the PES as a base line. If the PES is taken as a base
line, a code has to be included for each household member to
indicate whether (s)he:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>i.  Was also present in this household and dwelling at census time;

ii. Was temporarily absent from the household and dwelling at census
    &gt; time;

iii. Was born after the census; or

iv. Resided in a different household and dwelling at the time of the
    &gt; census.</code></pre>
<ol start="116" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Note that iv) also includes the situation in which the entire
household has moved from one physical dwelling to another. In
cases ii) and iv), it may be wise to ask if the person was
enumerated at the place where he or she spent census night. In
addition, it must be verified if any residents at the census time
have:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>i.  Died since then; or

ii. Become residents of a different household and dwelling since
    &gt; then.</code></pre>
<ol start="117" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>If the census is taken as a base line, the entire PES questionnaire
has to be filled out according to the situation at census time and
any changes have to be justified in terms of births, deaths and
migrations, or changes of physical dwelling.</p></li>
<li><p>Although the number of changes should be small, especially if the
PES is carried out very soon after the census, correctly classifying
them can be time-consuming, especially if the information is found
to be inconsistent at the time of matching. Take the case of a
household member who is declared in the PES as having been
temporarily absent from the household at census time, but who is
present in the household at the time of the PES (alternative ii).
The following possibilities exist:</p></li>
</ol>
<pre><code>i.  The person was declared as member of the household at census
    time and the census was organized according to the de jure
    criterion. This would be correct. The best practice (which is
    not attainable in countries without well-defined postal
    addresses) is to verify the census records of the place where
    this person was at census time to check if (s)he was enumerated
    there, to detect any potential double counting.

ii. The person was declared as member of the household at census
    time and the census was de facto. This would be wrong. If the
    person was also enumerated at the place where (s)he spent census
    night, it would be a case of double counting. If not, it would
    be a classification error.

iii. The person was not declared as a household member at census
    time and the census was organized according to the de jure
    criterion. Depending on the person&#39;s enumeration status in the
    place where (s)he was at census time, it would be a
    classification error or an omission.

iv. The person was not declared as a household member at census time
    and the census was de facto. This would be correct. But in this
    case, it would be particularly important to verify if (s)he was
    enumerated elsewhere.</code></pre>
<ol start="119" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Deciding whether a person was enumerated elsewhere in the census
also arises if the person permanently resided elsewhere at census
time. The best information obtainable in this case may be based on
his/her answer to the question, but verification may be impossible
in all but the most sophisticated PES operations.</p></li>
<li><p>A slightly different situation presents itself in the case of
persons who moved out of the household and dwelling after the
census. In theory the PES should try to locate these individuals, to
obtain their answers to the PES, to compare it to the census.
Countries with a long history and high level of technical expertise
in PES execution, such as Australia, actually collect this
information. But in the PES processes of most developing countries
this is impossible, and one has to assume that the PES data of such
persons coincide with what they declared in the census.</p></li>

survey</a>
(see also Case Study in Part II of this Manual) designed for
Mediterranean countries; the second is to include refugee screening
questions in a more general household survey such as a Labour Force
or Living Conditions Survey. The <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/1978984/6037334/Model-questionnaire-LFS-AHM-2014.pdf">European Union Labour Force Survey
had a special module in
2014</a>
designed to collect data on the labour market situation of migrants
and their descendants and includes questions to identify and
describe the situation of refugees and asylum seekers. It asks if
respondents migrated as a <em>refugee or seeking international
protection</em> in the previous 10 years and about obstacles to
participating and integrating in the labour market.</p></li>
<li><p>Where data on stocks and flows, and comparisons with the living
conditions of other groups in the population are required, then
screening questions on a regular survey may be the most
cost-effective methodology. This will depend on the incidence and
distribution of the refugee and refugee-related population in the
country and will require the input of a specialist sampling expert
to determine if adequate samples of the target population of refuges
are likely to be obtained.</p></li>
<li><p>Where detailed information about refugees and related populations
is required, then a specialist survey may be the preferred option,
but this likely to expensive and carried out rather infrequently. It
also depends on having a good quality sampling frame from which to
draw the sample.</p></li>

<p>Box 2.3: Jordan: The living conditions of Syrian refugees in Jordan:
Results from the 2017-2018 survey of Syrian refugees inside and outside
camps</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Drawing on a survey implemented by the Department of Statistics (DoS) between November 2017 and January 2018, the report presents recent statistics on Syrian refugees residing in Jordan. It presents findings for six geographic localities: Amman; Zarqa; Irbid; Mafraq; the other governorates taken together; and the refugee camps.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The report is based on information from 7,632 households and 40,950 individuals. Sampling was based on the DoS sampling frame constructed on the 2015 population census. A total of 1,121 clusters (locations) outside camps and 82 clusters inside camps were randomly selected. The sampling design was not geared towards estimating the number of Syrian refugees in the Hashemite Kingdom, but instead aimed for efficiency with regard to describing the Syrian refugee population in accordance with project objectives.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A household is defined as a unit that pools its resources together, and whose members usually sleep and eat (most meals) together. Usually, the household members are immediate or more distant relatives, but they do not have to be related. This report defines a refugee household as one where the head of household is a Syrian refugee. It understands a Syrian refugee to be any Syrian individual who fled to Jordan from Syria as a consequence of the crisis and war there and arrived in Jordan after 15 March 2011, and who acknowledges or defines him- or herself as a refugee; any Syrian national who resided in Jordan before 15 March 2011 and became a refugee because he or she could not return to Syria; or any children of these two categories of people born after 15 March 2011. The vast majority of these self-ascribed Syrian refugees, 97 per cent, have formalized their refugee status by registering with the UNHCR.</p>

<ol start="125" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>IRIS, 2020 recommends adding a set of screening questions to
national household surveys similar to those recommended for
population census (see paragraph 94 to 95) where the sample design
is suitable for obtaining reliable estimates. It also advises that
camps, reception centres, informal settlements and other
institutional accommodation should be included in the sampling
frame. Suitable questioning will be developed and included in future
editions of this Manual.</p></li>
<li><p>To measure IDPs’ living conditions globally, and particularly
whether they have overcome key displacement related vulnerabilities,
a core module will be developed and proposed as a standard approach
for periodic use in existing national multi-topic household surveys
such as the Living Standards Measurement Survey (LSMS), Demographic
Health Survey (DHS), Multiple Indicators Cluster Surveys (MICS) or
other multi-purpose surveys.</p></li>
<li><p>In order to maximize the quality, utility and comparability of data
collected globally, it is recommended that the model questionnaire
to be recommended is used to develop, design and test national
survey instruments, particularly related to questions on key
displacement related vulnerabilities. Maintaining consistency in
questions over time also allows for the creation of time-series for
IDP statistics.</p></li>
<li><p>There is some recent research work on methodologies improving the
estimates of consumption obtained from displaced households and
avoiding misreporting.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>"Indeed, survey respondents in IDP camps may believe that their
responses will influence the provision of humanitarian aid and will thus
misreport consumption in an attempt to influence its distribution. If
survey respondents are underreporting, the inaccuracies generated in the
data are highly problematic. At best, it makes the data spurious and
unusable. At worst, it could lead to misallocations of aid, from more
vulnerable areas to less vulnerable areas, or from solutions emphasizing
sustainability to immediate relief when immediate relief is unnecessary.
Given this context, light touch adaptations to the design of the survey
that prime the idea of honesty offer to make big improvements to the
quality of the data and support provisions the data informs.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.4.2</span> Design Frame</h3>
<p>"This only applies to processes which involve data collection based on
sampling, such as statistical surveys. It identifies and specifies the
population of interest, defines a sampling frame (and, where necessary,
the register from which it is derived), and determines the most
appropriate sampling criteria and methodology (which could include
complete enumeration).</p>
<p>Common sources for a sampling frame are administrative and statistical
registers, censuses and information from other sample surveys. This
sub-process describes how these sources can be combined if needed.
Analysis of whether the frame covers the target population should be
performed. A sampling plan should be made: The actual sample is created
in sub-process 4.1 (Create frame and select sample), using the
methodology, specified in this sub-process". (UNECE, 2013)</p>
<div id="b.1.-sampling-frames" class="section level4 ListParagraph">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.4.2.1</span> Sampling Frames</h4>
<ol start="131" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>A sample is a subset of units drawn from the target population of
interest. It is not usually convenient, efficient or possible to
examine every member of an entire population. Sampling reduces the
resources needed and, if done properly, provides estimates of the
population characteristics with known accuracy. Sampling is the
process of selecting units (e.g., households or individuals) from a
population of interest so that by studying the sample we may
generalize our results back to the population from which units were
selected.</p></li>
<li><p>Sampling design describes how the final sampling units are selected
and reached for the study. It is determined by the substantive goals
of the study, and by resource and logistical constraints. There are
different forms of designs in sampling.</p></li>
<li><p>Probability-based sampling ensures that every unit in the
population has a known chance (greater than zero) of being selected
in the sample, and its probability of selection can be accurately
determined. This makes it possible to produce unbiased estimates of
population totals, by weighting sampled units according to their
probability of selection.</p></li>
<li><p>Non-probability-based sampling is any sampling method where we do
not know the chance respondents have to be selected to the sample.
In most cases some elements of the population have no chance of
selection because the sampling strategy is based on decisions
related to convenience, quotas or deliberate choice of elements of
the population. In these cases, the probability of selection cannot
be determined. Because the selection of elements is non-random,
non-probability-based sampling does not allow the estimation of
sampling errors, and it is not possible to assume that biases cancel
each other out. When using non-probability based sampling the
ability of making inferences about the population is limited, and
the information generated needs to be treated carefully. Some
adaptations of non-probability-based sampling have been made to
allow for limited inferences. An example of this is
Respondent-Driven Sampling, (RDS) or Snowball Sampling that propose
ways of estimating weights to try to account for biases. See the
example below from Turkey of a two-stage sampling methodology
combining spatial and respondent driven sampling.</p></li>
<li><p>There are sampling constraints which should be considered when
designing a sample survey of displaced persons. Displaced people may
be a small proportion of the population, and it is likely that they
live in specific locations and are not evenly distributed around the
country or region. Any sample must be of a sufficient size and
design to yield reliable results. Each survey has its own sampling
design, even if it is similar from most national household surveys.
Using the sampling design for an existing national survey will
introduce a selection bias, if it is not amended to take account of
the living circumstances of displaced people. Refugees and IDPs can
live either in camps specially designated for displaced people or
they can live in houses among the general population, either as part
of another household or as an independent household.</p></li>
<li><p>In Somalia where security considerations prevented the usual
sampling techniques to be carried out an innovative technique was
used<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a>, (see <sup>Utz Pape and Philip Wollburg</sup>)<sup>.</sup> To address
security concerns, the Somalia High Frequency Survey adapted
logistical arrangements, sampling strategy, and questionnaire design
to limit time on the ground. In logistical arrangements, a detailed
and timely security assessment ensured that the enumeration areas
to‐be‐visited were safe on the day of fieldwork. The fieldwork
protocol was designed such that teams would spend as little time as
possible in any given region and draw little attention, ensuring
enumerator and respondent safety. Concerning sampling strategy, it
was not feasible to conduct a full listing of all households in an
enumeration area, as this was too time‐intensive and may have raised
suspicion. Instead, a micro‐listing approach was used, which
required enumeration areas to be segmented into smaller enumeration
blocks using satellite imagery. Enumeration blocks are small enough
for enumerators to list and select households immediately before
conducting the interview. (see also paragraph 350 and The High
Frequency Survey in South Sudan<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> also described in Part II of
this Manual - South Sudan).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Box 2.4: Turkey example: Two-Stage Sampling Methodology Combining
Spatial Survey and Respondent-Driven (Snowball) Sampling</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Context: WFP was interested in a vulnerability assessment of the refugee population in Turkey.
Challenge: Difficult to identify population (in this case, unregistered refugees), that are likely not randomly distributed geographically and have no comprehensive sampling frame.
Methodology: The study used a two-stage sampling methodology.
The first stage was a Simple Spatial Survey Method (S3M) that sought to select settlements evenly (rather than randomly) across Turkey’s geography. Using R’s spatial-sampler function, the researchers superimposed a hexagonal grid over the country, and then selected the refugee settlement that was closest to the nodes of the grid. It also stratified by urban/rural sites, although this stratification was later abandoned due to difficulty of reaching rural respondents. This grid-based sampling method lacks the benefits of true randomness but is acceptable if there is a belief that there are significant differences in geography that might not be adequately captured by a random sample.
The second stage was Respondent-Driven Sampling, which combined a snowball sample and probability weighting based on network theory. First researchers selected 2-3 seed households close to each of the geographic points (seeds) selected by the S3M model. The seed households were selected based on having strong social networks and willingness to participate, but researchers also tried to select households of different ages, genders, aid eligibility, and socioeconomic status. While this likely resulted in a more diverse set of initial households, if this stratification was conducted by field researchers in an ad hoc manner it may have unwittingly biased the sample. The researchers then used a snowball sampling method – after interviewing the first round of seed households, they asked each household to identify 2-3 additional refugee households who they could speak to. This process repeated at each subsequent step until the researchers had selected 25 respondent households from each seed. Based on the original 52 sampling sites, this generated a sample size of approximately 1,300 households.
Researchers then used the RDSAT application to analyse information about the respondent’s social network in order to generate an individual weighting value for each respondent that adjusts for their likelihood of being selected. This weighting process uses network theory to adjust for the non-random nature of the households who are more likely to be selected by this sampling method, and to arrive at a post-weighting sample that should be more representative of the general population. Analysis can then be performed on the post-weighting sample.
Conclusion: While this methodology can be used in situations in which there is no available frame and populations are hidden, it has several sources of bias that make it inferior to true probability sampling. For instance, there is a tendency for respondents to refer households who are similar to them in non-representative ways (e.g. select households from the same ethnic group). While the RDS application can help correct for some of this bias, it is important to ensure that the original seeds are representative of the population in a rigorous manner, and that this method not be used when more comprehensive sampling frames are available.</p>

<p>Box 2.5: Enumeration and Profiling of IDPs, refugees and migrants in
Hargeisa, Somaliland (December 2015)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Context: Somaliland had developed a policy framework on internal displacement in 2014, but still needed comprehensive and reliable data in order to inform its implementation by stakeholders.
Challenge: Study was starting from a very low-information baseline, and had difficulties getting access to a representative sample of the population due to resistance within the camp populations and the dispersed nature of the urban population.
Methodology:
Given the dearth of information available to researchers at the start of the study, the first stage of sampling was to develop a credible map of the population in the various settlements through information-gathering meetings with community focal points (imams, elders, teachers, community organizations). The next stage, enumeration, sought to reach all households in the camps with a brief 12-question census to establish membership to person of concern group (IDPs from Somaliland, Refugee returnees, Economic migrants, etc.). This census succeeded in reaching nearly 12-thousand households, and provided them each with a barcode that, along with phone numbers, was later used for randomization. Thus, the listing exercise resulted in multiple sampling frames of household as the final sampling units for the different populations of concern.
From the enumerated list of 11,962 households, 2,510 were selected to be surveyed. The randomization was stratified by person of concern category, so that the selected sample was proportionate to the population totals. Non-probabilistic sampling was applied to groups that did not have a population size large enough to support randomization (asylum seekers and IDPs from South Central Somalia).
As a result of the population size of some groups being small, as mentioned in the previous paragraph, the study also used non-probabilistic snowball sampling methods for the IDPs from South Central Somalia who lived in urban areas outside the camp, asking each respondent to refer additional households for the study. Due to the non-random nature of this selection mechanism, this cannot be considered a representative sample, although it may give a qualitative sense of overall IDP sentiments.
Limitations:
Due to community resistance to being categorized as IDPs, the enumeration stage was asked to conclude before it was able to reach all households living in the settlements. Thus there is a disconnect between the sample frame and the population of interest. There were also challenges with accessing refugees and asylum seekers directly – many declined to be interviewed, and others had had their enumeration barcodes taken by their landlords. While both of these elements contribute to a higher risk of bias within the sample, they speak more to the logistical difficulties inherent in working with IDP and refugee populations rather than any avoidable methodological problem with the study design. All possible mitigation steps should be taken to avoid these types of issues, but only if they can be addressed without jeopardizing the safety of researchers, the well-being of respondents, and the goodwill of communities.
There were also some challenges identifying the categories that were most appropriate for households, particularly between economic migrants and IDPs. If possible, it is important to establish clear and consistent guidelines whenever a categorization methodology is to be used.</p>

    registered with the authorities, versus refugees who are likely
    to more stable and often registered with the authorities once an
    application for asylum has be made and processed.

27. Size of displacement population in comparison to resident

<ol start="139" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The geographical scope and characteristics of the target population
should be determined. This involves describing where the members of
the target population are located, defining the boundaries of the
area they are in (e.g. administrative or natural boundaries), and,
if relevant to the study, adding any other information that
characterises the physical space of the target population such as
natural hazards or political situation.</p></li>
<li><p>The target population should further be narrowed down by
determining what differentiates them from the general resident
population of the study area (unless of course the latter is the
target population). This can for example be descriptions such as
“IDPs in urban settings in Colombia” or “refugees living in a camp”.
Vulnerabilities, specific age groups, socio-economic

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.4.4</span> Challenges in defining the target population and constructing a sampling frame and sample size</h3>
<ol start="142" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Ineligibles</strong>: Ineligibles are elements of the general population
who are not part of the target population of the study. These may be
non-IDPs who are erroneously selected in a sample of IDPs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Inaccuracies</strong>: Sampling frames obtained from previous surveys,
censuses or administrative data might contain outdated information.
For example, when using 5-year old census data of urban and rural
areas to draw a representative sample of the population, we need to
carefully assess whether population growth rates have been different
for rural and urban areas during these 5 years, or whether there
have been large population movements caused by displacements. If
there have been more people have been moving from the countryside to
cities than the other way around, but our sampling frame does not
account for it, then using the old census data would lead to
under-sampling of urban areas.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Missing information</strong>: In the context of forced displacement, it
can be difficult to obtain information to define target population
and construct sampling frames, especially for unregistered
out-of-camp populations. In such situations, alternative information
sources should be considered. These could include but are not
limited to; previous studies, scoping exercises, qualitative
assessments, key information interviews, desk review,
community-based methods to build sampling frames.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Multiple listing</strong>: Multiple listing denotes the situation where
a final sampling unit such as a household gets listed more than once
in the sampling frame. This can be a problem for example in
respondent-driven non-probability sampling frames where listed
households are asked if they know of other households that fit the
target population. One household can easily be mentioned more than
once. Sampling frames need to be carefully assessed and cleaned to
ensure no final sampling unit appears more than once.</p></li>

<li><p>There are several potential sources of non-survey data on displaced
people, the first is national population registers, the second is
administrative data maintained by governments for the purpose of
administering a range of services, controlling migration or issuing
documentation, and the third is operational data kept by
humanitarian agencies and governments for the purposes of supporting
displaced people. This section gives examples of population
registers, supplemented administrative records; and describes the
operational data maintained by UNHCR about displaced populations and
the way it is used.</p></li>
<li><p>Eurostat, in its Reference and Management of Nomenclatures system
(RAMON) defines administrative data as a <strong>"</strong>Database which is
updated continuously (often for administrative purposes, such as
population registers or building registers) and from which
statistics can be extracted / aggregated / computed".<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Administrative data are a useful source of information for
measuring both the stock of displaced populations, and potentially
the flows. If they include variables allowing the identification of
the target population, or if the specific administrative source can
be linked at the individual level to another data source such as
another register, a survey or a census, then they provide potential
for integrating a number of sources (See next section Data Source D:
Integrated Data). This can potentially be a rich source of
statistics.</p></li>
<li><p>Very diverse types of primary administrative data may be of
interest from a statistical point of view, these include:</p></li>
</ol>
<pre><code>28. Specific registers maintained by administrations or
    organisations responsible for refugees and IDPs (including
    registration of displaced people in camps and/or elsewhere).

29. Databases maintained by humanitarian organisations supporting
    refuges in informal settlements. These are often linked to the
    beneficiaries accessing displacement specific services and
    benefits.

30. General population registers of the total resident population of
    a country and/or registers of foreign citizens.

31. Other administrative registers (residence permit registers, tax
    registers, social security registers, register of border
    crossings etc.).</code></pre>
<ol start="150" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Such administrative registers are, in particular, the main data
source for statistics on asylum applicants and decisions taken
during the asylum application process in regions such as Europe and
Northern America. In the EU and in some additional neighbouring
countries, they are also the main source of statistics on the number
of refugees living in the country through specific sub-categories of
reasons to stay in the residence permits statistics (refugees legal
status, subsidiary protection, humanitarian reasons) and statistics
on persons who are the subject of pending applications for
international protection (asylum seekers whose application is still
being examined).</p></li>
<li><p>In many countries without the current capacity to maintain
administrative registers, UNHCR maintains registers on behalf of the
government until the necessary capacity is developed. Arrangements
can be made for accessing these registers for statistical purposes.</p></li>
<li><p>A number of countries keep population registers, and several
examples of these are described in this manual. The United Nations’
<em>Recommendations on Statistics on International Migration Revision
1</em> (1998) provides useful guidance for utilising administrative data
sources for migration statistics in general, and refugee statistics
in particular. These recommendations can be adapted for IDP
registers, however IDPs are often not included, and if they are then
they may not be identifiable as IDPs because their movements have
not been captured.</p></li>
<li><p>According to these recommendations, two types of administrative
sources should be considered for the collection of migration
statistics:</p></li>
</ol>
<pre><code>32. Administrative registers, defined as &quot;a data system providing
    for the continuous recording of selected information pertaining
    to each member of the target population&quot; and including
    &quot;population registers, registers of foreigners and other special
    type of registers covering particular groups of persons, such as
    registers of asylum seekers&quot; (United Nations, 1998, p. 17).

33. Other administrative sources derived &quot;from the operation of
    administrative procedures designed to control international
    migration&quot; including sources related to &quot;the issuance of
    residence permits&quot;, &quot;the issuance of work permits&quot;,
    &quot;applications for asylum&quot;, &quot;tax or social security&quot;, and &quot;border
    collections&quot; (United Nations, 1998, pp. 20, 23).</code></pre>
<ol start="154" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>To be useful for IDP statistics the system must be accessible to
those who have been displaced and be regularly updated to reflect
recent movements, changes of circumstances and to reflect flows in

exited from the stock.</p></li>
<li><p>For refugees and refugee related populations asylum seekers are
often not treated as part of the usually resident population and are
therefore omitted from the population register. Registers of asylum
seekers or foreigners may also be required to complete the
statistical estimates, (see Part II of this Manual: Hungary see
para. 589, and Turkey Case Studies see para. 630 and 654.</p></li>
<li><p>The use of “registers of asylum seekers” is specifically
recommended for estimating the stock of asylum seekers (by length of
stay in the country) and the number of new asylum applications
within a given year (United Nations, 1998, p. 19), and for producing
statistics on the outcome of the asylum procedure.</p></li>
<li><p>Two types of units are used to record applications, “cases or
applications” and “persons <span class="math display">\[covered by these cases or

publish official statistics on persons involved in forced migration.
National Directorate-General for Aliens Policing (NDGAP) is the
authority which is responsible for the asylum procedure in Hungary.
The NDGAP produces statistics on the asylum procedure, on numbers of
persons taken under international protection status (refugees under
the Geneva Convention and persons taken under subsidiary protection)
and the figures of the persons who receive national humanitarian
status (persons who are taken under the principle of non-

<li><p>The NDGAP decides on the asylum applications<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a>, recognising
refugees under the Geneva Convention and persons who are under
subsidiary protection. Data is forwarded to the Ministry of Interior
which runs the Population and Address Register (PAR). In Hungary the
persons taken under international protection are issued with an
identity card (and have similar rights to Hungarian citizens) and
therefore their data is stored in the population register.</p></li>
<li><p>In contrast to asylum seekers who are not considered to be part of

<li><p>Refugee statistics in Norway are produced from administrative data.
All asylum seekers must register with the Norwegian immigration
authorities, and their case data and personal data are stored in a
database maintained by the Norwegian Directorate of Immigration
(UDI). The database contains data on UN convention refugees as well
as refugees who enter Norway on their own and apply for asylum.</p></li>
<li><p>The UDI statistics division has access to copies of raw data from
the database and has the ability to extract, aggregate and process
the data in whatever way it chooses. At the same time, selected
personal and case data are transferred directly from the case
processing system to the Central Population Register (CPR), and from
there transferred to Statistics Norway through daily batch jobs. UDI
also provides supplemental, processed data to Statistics Norway in a
data set that is compiled every year. The most important variable in
this data set is each immigrant’s reason for immigration.</p></li>
<li><p>An obvious <span class="underline">advantage</span> of this system is that the
producers of official statistics on refugees – Statistics Norway
and UDI – have excellent access to data as well as control of how
the data is processed, analysed and disseminated.</p></li>
<li><p>A major <span class="underline">challenge</span> is that data collection first and
foremost is designed and built for case processing, not to produce
statistics. Hence, the main purpose of the data collection is to
facilitate the flow of applications through the administrative
systems, while keeping track of the applicants’ legal status and
rights. Many people are involved in the handling of each
application, and the system is built to enable each case handler to
finish tasks and transfer the case to the next person, through all
the steps from application to final decision. For this purpose, it
may not even be necessary to access or collect structured data, as
many case processing tasks can be resolved simply based on case
documents.</p></li>

<li><p>All addresses within the boundaries of the country were registered
in the National Address Database (NAD) in 2006, and by linking
addresses of Turkish citizens living within the boundaries of the
country with the Turkish identification number, Address Based
Population Registration System (ABPRS) was established in 2007.
Subsequently, in order to obtain information which was not available
in the ABPRS at provincial level, Population and Housing Survey
(PHS) was conducted using a combined methodology (by linking the
ABPRS to a large-scale sample survey) in 2011. According to the
Official Statistics Programme, annual information on population size
by administrative division (province, district, town, village and
quarter), and its basic characteristics (age-sex structure, place of
registration, nationality, literacy and educational attainment,
legal marital status, place of birth, type of households, and
internal migration in province level) are produced from ABPRS and
announced to the public in January of the following year.</p></li>
<li><p>TurkStat is responsible for producing stock and flow statistics on
international migration by demographic and other related indicators
of migrants. For foreigners residing in Turkey, citizenship and
country of birth statistics are produced from ABPRS. In addition,
TurkStat produced information on immigration and emigration, namely
annual migration flow statistics, for the first time based on
administrative registers in 2018 for the years 2016 and 2017.
Similar to the statistics on foreign stock population, migration
flow statistics covering both Turkish citizens and foreigners are
produced in “country of birth” and “country of citizenship”
breakdowns (no disaggregation by refugee or refugee like
populations). In order to obtain the statistics on foreign
population residing in Turkey, foreign registers held by the General
Directorate of Civil Registration and Nationality (GDCRN) and the
residence-work permit registers are mainly used.</p></li>
<li><p>Along with the Göç-Net (migration management system), registers of
residence permits, international protection (applications, refugee,
conditional refugee, subsidiary protection, and temporary protection
under international protection), illegal migration and other events
related to foreigners are kept in connection to each other.
Directorate General of Migration Management (DGMM) is responsible
for collection, analysis and dissemination of the data on
international protection, residence permits and irregular migration.</p></li>
<li><p>Principal variables defined concerning applicants of international
protection are age, gender, educational status, nationality and
marital status etc. Statistical figures on international protection
applications are shared on DGMM’s official website and published in
Annual Migration Reports of DGMM on a yearly basis.</p></li>
<li><p>With the <em>“Temporary Protection Regulation”</em> issued in 2014,
Syrians seeking international protection were given temporary
protection status in Turkey. Syrians are granted a foreign
identification number to benefit from health, education, labour
market access and social support services. Based on the legal
(de-jure) population definition, Syrians under temporary protection
are not covered in the Address Based Population Registration System
(ABPRS). Thus, this population group is not officially accepted as
“resident population”. Only the Syrians who entered the country
legally (with the required official documents such as a passport)
are included in ABPRS population like other foreigners holding a
residence permit/work permit. Briefly, while approximately 3.5
million Syrians under temporary protection are not covered in ABPRS,
the number of Syrians in the ABPRS was just 87,955 as of December
31, 2018.</p></li>
<li><p>The number of persons under temporary protection in Turkey was
14,000 in 2012 reached 225,000 thousand in 2013, 1.5 million in

update socio economic variables of IDPs at an individual level.
Other relevant datasets are the official education enrolment system,
the social security system, the registers´ office, the housing and

<li><p>The official source to count the stock of IDPs in Colombia is the
Single Victims` Registry managed by the Victims` Unit, a
government agency responsible for providing assistance and
reparation to victims of the armed conflict. The Single Victims´
Registry has been counting IDPs since 1985. At October 2019, 7.5
million IDPs were registered.  IDP households who wish to be
included in the Single Victims´ Registry present a declaration
before the Public Ministry (Ombudsman´s Regional Office,
Procurator´s Municipal Office).  According to the national
legislation an IDP has to declare within two years after the event
of displacement took place. Once an IDP is granted the status of
victim, they are included in the Single Victims´ Registry. Once
registered they are entitled to access relevant assistance and
reparation. </p></li>
<li><p>An individual assessment of vulnerability is run twice a year for
IDPs registered in the Single Victims´ Registry. The data used to
run the assessment comes from both primary and secondary sources. 
Primary data is collected through a survey conducted by phone on a
continuous basis. Secondary data, which is the main source of data,
involves the exchange of official administrative records with other
government agencies at both national and local level. Additionally,
IDPs update their location directly to the Victims´ Unit through
services points located throughout the country.  </p></li>
<li><p>There is a Protocol for Information Exchange between the Victims`
Unit and all the government agencies which form part of the National
System for the Assistance and Reparation of Victims. The process of
information exchange is formalised through a Memorandum of
Understanding, in compliance with the relevant legislation. </p></li>

<li><p>Because of the variety and the varying coverage of the possible
sources containing statistical information on refugee and internally
displaced persons (IDPs), data integration is a promising solution
for improving the quality of refugee and IDPs statistics. Recent
projects like the UNECE High Level Group for the Modernisation of
Official Statistics (HLG-MOS) or the Eurostat ESS 2020 vision
project in the area of data integration witness of the growing
interest for data integration.</p></li>
<li><p>In particular, data integration can answer several challenges
raised when compiling official statistics on refugee and IDPs by:</p></li>
</ol>
<pre><code>34. Improving the coverage of target groups,

<li><p>The objective of this part of the Manual is to present the main
steps related to data integration as well as an overview on the
possible data integration techniques which can help and guide
practitioners in NSOs interested in applying data integration to
refugee and IDPs statistics. As far as possible, the provided
information will be illustrated by existing good practices in NSOs
and will be completed by more detailed technical information and
references about the presented methods.</p></li>
<li><p>This section is an edited version of the full text on data
integration. A much fuller description of options and techniques can
be found in Part 3 of this report PART III – 2D Data Integration
Techniques.</p></li>
<li><p>The first step is to clearly define the output objectives of
integration and to agree this with the providers of the data sources
to be used. This is followed by a discussion of the several issues
that NSOs will face if they want to apply data integration
techniques; these issues relate to the legal environment and data
protection legislation, the relationships with external data
providers, the required IT resources and the skills needed. The next
section addresses issues pertaining to the main sources which could
be the object of data integration and is followed by the main data
integration statistical methods. These methods are illustrated by
examples of good practices. Since any data integration process
actually covers all the phases of the GSBPM, practitioners and data
compilers can refer to the other parts of the Compilers’ Manual for
more detailed information on the statistical tasks common to all
statistical processes, such as the quality assessment or the design

<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.6.1.2</span> Data availability, accessibility and other requirements</h4>
<ol start="203" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The design of the integration methodology constitutes one of the
main tasks to be realised in data integration. Besides the technical
tasks, good collaboration with external data providers and other
involved stakeholders is of high importance when designing the data
collection, production system and workflows. Very often, the sources
that are considered for data integration are not under the direct
responsibility of statistical authorities. The first requirement is
to ensure the data’s availability and accessibility, as well as to
have in place the capacities to use them (see also Phase 1.5. Check
Data Availability).</p></li>
<li><p>This process is obviously strongly dependent on the national
context, in particular the legal environment as well as the status
of the various statistical authorities. The following paragraphs
will describe in more detail the main tasks to achieve taking into
account the potential national context. Assessment of the points set
out below should be undertaken at the very first stage and help to
construct a business plan for data integration.</p></li>
</ol>
<pre><code>*a. Legal environment and data protection legislation*</code></pre>
<ol start="205" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Some countries provide a legal basis for the NSO to access data and
metadata for all available administrative data sources for
evaluating their potential use in official statistics. If, based on
the metadata, the data source is judged to be useful to build new or
improve existing official statistics, then test data can be
requested to further assess data quality and to produce prototype
statistics.</p></li>
<li><p>A guarantee of data confidentiality, ethical standards, as well as
the legal environment obliges NSOs to guarantee the confidentiality
of data, either for dissemination or when sharing data with other
providers. In particular, NSOs shall avoid direct identification or
indirect identification of the respondent (statistical unit). Direct
identification means identification of the respondent from their
formal identifiers (name, address, identification number), whereas
indirect identification means inferring a respondent's identity by
a combination of variables or characteristics (e.g. age, gender,
education etc). Concerning dissemination, statistical disclosure
control can use methods like tabular data protection for aggregate
information on respondents presented in tables (use of suppression,
rounding, randomisation and/or interval publication) and micro-data
protection (using local suppression, sampling, global recoding, top
and bottom coding, rounding, rank swapping and micro-aggregation).
Concerning the storage of data, physical protection guarantee that
the data is securely stored and not accessible to anyone without
explicit authorisation. When coming to data integration (micro-data
sharing with external data providers), the use of anonymisation
techniques (see also <em>g. Security environment</em> discussed below)
shall guarantee the confidentiality of the data shared.</p></li>
</ol>
<pre><code>*b. Cooperation with external data providers*</code></pre>
<ol start="207" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Political willingness and technical readiness are essential.
Considerations of data security tend to dominate, and a data sharing
agreement is a requirement, this should identify the data points to
be shared, and the modalities of data transfer. The following issues
are recommended:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>44. Building trust, depoliticizing the discourse.

45. Define cooperation with data providers and other involved
    stakeholders (administration, NGOs, other) through clear MOUs
    (&quot;data used for this and only this&quot;, safeguard of
    confidentiality by statistical authorities). What are the
    precise requirement and limits of use of the data, access to
    micro or macro data?

46. Undertaking a comprehensive mapping of the systems and of the
    data.

47. Ownership of the results by statistical authorities.

48. Presentation to external stakeholders of the foreseen output
    (data to be collected, flows, stocks and other variables to be
    produced, analytical purposes).

49. Mapping in collaboration with data providers between the
    information contained in various sources and the official
    statistics needs.

50. Design of the data collection process in cooperation with
    external data providers (including metadata).

51. Design production systems and workflows in cooperation with
    external data providers (software, connection between various
    stakeholders, IT resources, etc).

52. Sustainability of the envisaged process.

<li>As the list of possible sources presented in <em>Table 2.19: Main
characteristics of potential data sources for integration</em> shows, a
unique source does not exist that is capable of drawing a complete
statistical picture of refugees and IDPs. Either in term of coverage
or data availability, usually only integration of several sources
can lead to the production of the necessary statistics for the
users. Most often, integration of several sources, requires the
linking of several data sources at the micro-level by using an
identifier common to all the involved sources. Sometimes, data
integration can also consist in using several sources at a more
aggregated level in order to derive the best estimate of a target
value, in particular the total number of a population. In both
cases, micro and macro data integration, output objectives of the

<li>One of the main challenges in any data integration project is how
to establish the link between the different data sets, and the fact
that those data sources usually have different structures. Depending
on how the data need to be integrated, this can be generalized into
2 main categories;</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>80. **Data linking (Join):** normally a common variable is required
    in multiple data sets to establish a link. This common variable
    or variables is called a Join Key. It could be one unique
    identifier used in 2 data sets such as a national ID number, or
    it could be set of quasi identifiers that exists in both data
    sets. The figure below illustrates an example of what needs to
    be done to expand the data set horizontally or by adding more
    variables to analysed data set.</code></pre>

come from multiple sources and the aim is to create one unified

structure and variable scopes, there might be a need to transform
the variables before adding them to the consolidated dataset. For
example, in one data set there might be date of birth while the
target dataset uses the year of birth. In that case one needs to
transform date of birth before loading the data into the target
dataset. As under the previous example, one can think of what needs
to be done to expand the data set vertically or by adding more
observations to analysed dataset.</li>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.7.1</span> Data editing and imputation</h3>
<ol start="220" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>When using multisource data, inconsistencies at micro level are
frequently encountered. Integration of data sources at micro-level
may give rise to composite records that consist of a combination of
values obtained from several different sources. For instance, a
register could be combined with values obtained from a survey for
the same units (obtained by record linkage); or from an integration
of several surveys with non-overlapping units, in which case a unit
from one source is matched with a similar (but not identical) unit
from another source. Records with values obtained from different
sources can also arise as a consequence of item non-response and
subsequent imputation, in which case the two sources are the
directly observed values versus the values generated by the
imputation method. In all these cases the composition of a record by
combining information obtained from different sources may lead to
consistency problems because the information is conflicting, in the
sense that edit rules that involve variables obtained from the
different sources are violated. The purpose of editing conflicting
micro-data is to achieve numerical consistency in the first instance
and, ultimately, statistical consistency of the resulting
aggregates.</p></li>
<li><p>For example, a survey provides an aggregated value A for the total
income received from social allowances received by person x; this
value A should be equal to the sum of two types of allowances B
(health) and C (education) collected through administrative sources.
If A is not equal to the sum of B and C, this inconsistency should
be removed by using micro integration methods<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> like prorating,
minimum adjustment methods, or generalised Ratio Adjustments. In the
case of data on refugee and internally displaced persons, such
aggregation rules when integrating several sources should be rather
rare, but their existence should be checked on a case by case basis,
and data compilers should take them into account if necessary. Micro
integration or editing conflicting micro-data needs to be
distinguished from variable harmonisation (later on described) which
applies to situations where there exist similar versions of the same
target variable, for instance due to different definitions across
the sources.</p></li>

<div id="d.2.-creation-of-joint-statistical-micro-data" class="section level3 ListParagraph">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.7.2</span> Creation of joint statistical micro data</h3>
<ol start="222" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>A full description of a) <em>data linkage: combining data from several
sources belonging to the same group, and b) data matching: inference
of joint distribution from marginal observations, can be found in
greater detail in Part III of this Manual</em> <em>Creation of joint
statistical micro data. </em></p></li>
<li><p>The integration of data at micro level with the main purpose of
accurately reflecting the individual’s real-world circumstances at
individual micro level, even when the data are stored in different
sources of various types, is known as record linkage. Ultimately,
the record linkage process creates a micro dataset where the
corresponding separate observations are combined into joint
statistical data drawn from information which originate in multiple
sources. Record linkage is also referred to as object
identification, record matching, entity matching, entity resolution,
or reference reconciliation. In the case of the National Statistical
Institutes (NSIs) the joint use of statistical and administrative
sources is a product of a rationalization of all the available
sources in order to reduce costs, response burden and, most of all,
to enrich the information collected in order to produce high quality
statistics.</p></li>
<li><p>An important distinction between record linkage and statistical
matching needs to be made, the former regards the “fusion” of
sources composed mainly of the same units, partially or completely
overlapping, e.g., in the case of integration of administrative
registers and sample surveys, while the latter concerns the
integration of different units, e.g. derived from different sample
surveys.</p></li>
<li><p>The record linkage problem requires statistical estimation methods
when unique identifiers are not available for all the units in the
sources, or the unique keys are affected by errors, or a unique
composite key can be derived from a combination of error-prone
variables. The presence of errors in the unit identifiers and the
use of statistical estimation methods for linking data files, may
introduce linkage errors in the integrated data. This point needs to
be taken into consideration by data compilers’ during the design of
the data linkage process. Actually, a standard statistical
estimation approach can produce inaccurate results in case of
linkage errors, which requires the use of statistical methods in
order to evaluate and adjust for linkage errors.</p></li>
<li><p>In <strong>statistical matching</strong>, also referred to as data fusion, the
ultimate aim is to provide estimates on variables observed in
distinct data sources by exploiting the available common information
(variables observed in both data sources). The data to be joined is
characterized by representing the same population but not
necessarily having common units. Thus, statistical matching can be
framed as an imputation problem in which a missing target variable
for units in a recipient data set is predicted based on information
on similar units (“statistical twins”) observed in a donor data set.</p></li>
<li><p>A statistical matching problem can be defined according to its
objective and data availability:</p></li>
</ol>
<pre><code>82. (objective) knowledge on a (possibly conditional) joint
    distribution function of a couple of random variables, or on
    some of the parameters representing the (conditional) joint
    relationship between the two random variables, or on a data set
    representative of the (conditional) joint distribution of the
    two variables, is requested;

83. (available data) the two random variables of interest are not
    available jointly in any datasets, but it is possible to use two
    random samples, each one observing one of the two random
    variables, both observing all the conditioning variables.
    Furthermore, the two samples should be representative of the
    same population, but the overlap between the two observed sets
    of units is either null or consists of subsets of units that are
    not representative of the population itself.</code></pre>
<ol start="228" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The two most important outputs that statistical matching can
produce are: either macro (estimation of a joint distribution or of
a relationship parameter) or micro (a data set with complete
observations on the variables of interest, i.e. both the couple of
random variables and the conditioning variables). It is worthwhile
noting that the macro approach to statistical matching may be also
be considered as a ‘Multisource estimation at aggregated level’. In
the field of refugee and IDP statistics, the micro-objective (fusion
of two datasets) is the most frequent possible use of data matching.</p></li>

examples, can be found in Part III) Creation of joint statistical
micro data.</p></li>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.7.3</span> Alignment of populations and measurements</h3>
<p><em>a. Alignment of populations: Unit harmonisation</em></p>
<ol start="230" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>When data originating from multiple sources are used, one needs to
transform objects into statistical units referring to the target
population. This is a mandatory requirement valid both for usages
based on a single data source, and for cases based on multisource
data. After a preliminary analysis aimed at verifying such a
consistency, it is sometimes necessary to start a process of
harmonisation or alignment of statistical units. For example, when
combining survey data with administrative registers, to create a
living household as the ideal unit for refugee or IDP statistics,
one needs to make use of units such as person, family, residence
address, study or workplace address, etc. The different units need
first to be aligned with each other, in order to improve the
accuracy of the living household created based on them.</p></li>
<li><p>Possible estimation methods: No general statistical methods are
available, while ad-hoc deterministic methods are generally used.
For instance, statistical units are derived using certain
deterministic derivation rules based on available information.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><em>b. Alignment of measurements: Variable harmonisation</em></p>
<ol start="232" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>When administrative data are used, one needs to transform
attributes of the objects into measurements referring to the
concepts to be measured, that is the target variables. After a
preliminary analysis aimed at verifying such a consistency, it is
sometimes necessary to start a process of harmonisation or alignment
of measurements.</p></li>
<li><p>When data from multiple sources are combined, differences in
definition can occur between variables in different sources. In
particular, variables in an administrative data source are defined
according to the administrative purposes of the register owner.
These definitions may differ from those of the target variables for
statistical purposes. For example, when the variable ‘age-group’ is
observed in two data sources with different groups. A technique for
obtaining a unique variable ‘age’ is needed. This apparently
deterministic task can involve statistical estimation method (e.g.,
classification techniques) whenever a well-defined mapping is not
known.</p></li>
<li><p>In case differences in variable definitions occur between data
sources, these variables need to be harmonised during data
integration. That is to say, for each unit in the integrated data
set, the values of the target variable according to the desired
definition need to be estimated from the observed values that are
available.</p></li>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.7.4</span> Multisource estimation at aggregated level</h3>
<ol start="235" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>This task refers to the phase of production of estimates by using
integrated multisource administrative data. Estimation methods in
this case must deal with the problem that data are not obtained
according to a random sampling design, and that observations may
refer to specific subsets of units of the population
(under-coverage), or out-of-scope units (over-coverage). In
addition, when integrated multisource data are used, specific
problems may arise. They are concerned with the problem of
consistency and coherence of estimates.</p></li>
<li><p>Part III of this Manual (paragraphs 836-869) describes a number of
estimation and reconciliation techniques in much further detail
including:</p></li>
</ol>
<p><em>a. Population size estimation: multiple lists with imperfect coverage
of target population.</em></p>
<ol start="237" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>When each one of the multiple sources has imperfect coverage of the
target population, including both under- and over-coverage,
statistical methods for population size estimation are needed. The
most common approaches relate to capture-recapture (CRC) methods. In
estimating a population size based on several sources, the
misalignment between the scope of the administrative data and that
of the statistician poses several methodological challenges and sets
us apart from a classical capture-recapture setting. For instance,
it is often useful to develop methods taking into account the
dependence among data sources, the fact that some data sources refer
to a specific subpopulation, and that data may contain units
out-of-the target population that are not deterministically
identifiable.</p></li>
<li><p>In the case of refugees or IDPs statistics, the first assumption
can be considered as true if the time between the capture and
recapture is limited. Otherwise, deaths, births, and moves of the
population of interest will break the hypothesis of a closed
population. The validity of the second assumption depends on the
quality of the available identifier for linking the sources.
Difficult to reach refugees or IDPs through surveys will most likely
not be recorded in administrative registers, which can break the
third assumption and imply a problem of under-coverage. The fourth
assumption corresponds to the fact that for example children, women
and men have the same probability of inclusion. In case this is not
verified, applying the CRC method to each identified specific group
before proceeding to an aggregation of the results found for each
group. Lastly, the fifth hypothesis could be assumed to be verified
in most of the cases.</p></li>
<li><p>The violation of these assumptions can lead to serious bias in the
CRC-estimation of the population size. CRC is in particular
sensitive to violation of the assumption in the case of a low
implied coverage, i.e. the second register overlaps greatly with the
first register and adds relatively few new records to it. So,
several extensions of the CRC method were proposed in order to face
problems connected to violation of the basic assumptions, we can
divide them into two group: methods aiming at improving the
CRC-method; alternatives methods.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><em>b. Reconciliation</em></p>
<ol start="240" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Different estimates for the same phenomenon could lead to confusion
among users of these figures. Many NSIs have therefore adopted a
one-figure policy. According to this one-figure policy, estimates
for the same phenomenon in different tables should be reconciled,
meaning that they should be equal to each other, even if these
estimates are based on different underlying data sources.</p></li>
<li><p>When using a mix of administrative data sources and surveys on
which to base estimates upon, obtaining one estimate for the same
phenomenon may become problematic as for different (combinations of)
variables data on different units, e.g. different persons, may be
available.</p></li>
<li><p>This means that different estimates concerning the same variable
may yield different results, if one does not take special
precautions. For instance, if one uses a standard weighting approach
to produce estimates, where one multiplies observed counts or values
with surveys weights, one may get different estimates based on two
samples, because different units and hence different survey weights
are used in the two samples.</p></li>
<li><p>In principle, these differences are merely caused by “noise” in the
data, such as sampling errors. So, in a strictly statistical sense,
different estimates concerning the same variables are to be expected
and are not a problem. However, different estimates would violate
the one-figure policy and form a problem for the users.</p></li>

<div id="the-population-register-and-links-to-other-administrative-registers-in-norway" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.7.5.2</span> The population register and links to other administrative registers in Norway</h4>
<ol start="245" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The Central Population Register (CPR) of Norway was established in
1964 based on the 1960 Population Census. A unique 11-digit personal
identification number (PIN) was introduced at the same time. The CPR
includes all persons who has ever been a (legal) resident of Norway
since 1960, regardless of their citizenship. Persons who die or
emigrate are not deleted from the register, but a code for their
status is changed.</p></li>
<li><p>The most important stock (or status) variables in the CPR are:
11-digit PIN (which includes date of birth and sex), residence
status (resident, deceased, emigrated, no permanent address,
disappeared), address, municipality, dwelling number, place of birth
(municipality or country), name (incl. first and middle names),
citizenship, country of immigration, country of emigration, marital
status, PIN of spouse, mother and father.</p></li>
<li><p>Persons who have come to Norway as refugees or asylum seekers are
included in the CPR once they are recognized as legal residents.
Refugees who arrive via UNHCR are given a PIN on arrival. Asylum
seekers are assigned another ID number, called the D-number, when
they apply for asylum. The D-number is used for administrative
purposes for people who are not residents of Norway but who have
economic or other links to Norway. It is only when a person is
granted asylum that he or she is assigned a PIN number. Persons with
D-numbers are not included in the official population statistics for
Norway</p></li>
<li><p>All vital events and migrations and address changes are registered
in the CPR. The most important flow variables are births, deaths,
marital changes (incl. same-sex marriages, separations, divorces and
annulments), emigrations and immigrations, internal moves in Norway,
address changes, name changes, citizenship changes, gender changes
and PIN changes. When a report of a change is received by the CPR
the information is checked, for example, that the spouses of a new
marriage are not already married and that the parents of a new-born
baby are residents.</p></li>
<li><p>The inclusion of the PINs of parents and spouses in the CPR makes
it possible to establish links between siblings, cousins, children,
grandparents and other relatives. The PIN is used in a large number
of other administrative registers, which makes it possible to link
information in different registers for statistics and research. The
CPR is also used to draw samples for sample surveys. The contents,
coverage and quality of the administrative registers have become so
good that it is not any longer necessary to conduct traditional
population and housing censuses. The last regular census was
conducted in 2001, whereas the 2011 census was completely based on
register data.</p></li>
<li><p>The two figures below show the flows of data on individuals
(microdata) to and from the CPR. The entity at the middle of both
figures, “Population register”, functions both as the central
register of civil events in Norway and as the country’s population
register. Thus, civil registration and national identity management
are fully integrated. Births to residents of Norway and new
immigrants are assigned personal identification numbers. Residents
who die or emigrate are not physically removed from the register,
but their codes are changed from “Resident” to “Dead” or
“Emigrated”.</p></li>
<li><p>The first figure shows that the population register receives
microdata <em>from</em> many public (and some private) institutions on
births, deaths, many external migrations, marriages and divorces,
adoptions, address changes, name changes, and other events. It also
receives information directly from the individuals themselves on
internal migration, many external migrations, and name changes.</p></li>
<li><p>It should be noted that the population register does not receive
any microdata <em>from</em> Statistics Norway, with a few exceptions, in
keeping with the fundamental principles of statistics, that
individual data collected by statistical agencies for statistical
compilation are to be strictly confidential and used exclusively for
statistical purposes. The second figure shows the public and private
institutions <em>to</em> which the Norwegian Tax Administration distributes
microdata. Statistics Norway is one of the most important recipients
and users of these data, together with health and educational
institutions, the police, the army, the electoral register, banks,
and other bodies.</p></li>
<li><p>The task of sharing the microdata is not performed by Statistics
Norway, but by the owner of the administrative register, the
Norwegian Tax Administration. Statistics Norway may, however, share
anonymized data on individuals if this is approved by the data
inspector.</p></li>

<li>Statistics Norway receives updates on vital events and other
changes in the register every night, five days a week, following the
same routine as many other users of the population register that
need daily updates for administrative purposes. The updates are
verified every morning. The diagram below shows the relationship
between the administrative and statistical population registers.
Statistics Norway maintains two versions of the population register:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>A true copy of the administrative register;</p></li>
<li><p>A separate statistical population register, in which internal
adjustments and amendments are made and saved.</p></li>

</div>
<ol start="255" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The key reason for this approach is that the administrative
register is incomplete and may include errors and other
shortcomings, such as missing data. Statistics Norway has access to
many other administrative and statistical data sources and can link
them to the copy of the central population register to check for
possible errors or add information, such as country of birth if not
registered by the CPR. This information cannot be shared with the
Tax Administration without permission from the other sources for
confidentiality reasons, but it still has an impact on the quality
of the statistics produced. Statistics Norway may, however, report
faulty microdata (including the PIN) back to the register owner,
including the Tax Administration, as this may be considered a
complaint regarding the quality of the data received. These error
correction procedures must be in line with the principle that data
relating to individuals should not be returned from a statistical
agency to a supplier. The quality improvements mean that, in most
cases, the statistical population register is a better source for
statistics production than the administrative population register
(CPR) would have been.</p></li>
<li><p>It is not possible to identify refugees/(former) asylum seekers
directly in the CPR as information about reason for
migration/residence permit is not one of the variables that is
included in the original transactions from the CPR. However, this
information is collected on a yearly basis where Statistics Norway
receives data from the Directorate of Migration (this procedure is
described more in detail in box 4.6 in the IRRS) and link these data
using the PIN to match the statistical version with the CPR. Based
on this information, Statistics Norway produces both flow and stock
data on persons with a refugee background, see:

<ol start="257" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>In Norway, population, migration and refugee statistics – both on
stocks and on flows - is primarily based on register data from the
Central Population Register (CPR), a register situated in the
Norwegian Tax Administration. Statistics Norway (SSB) maintains a
copy of the CPR – kept for statistical purposes - and receives
electronic transaction data from the CPR every night.</p></li>
<li><p>The same definitions are used in both the CPR and in the SSB copy
of the register and routines for updating correspond closely. The
result is a good correspondence between the two registers, even
after many years with physically independent updating routines.
However, in addition to the variables received from the CPR, SSB
constructs several variables that are needed for statistical
purposes.</p></li>
<li><p>One of these is the variable ‘migration category’ which is used for
determining the population with immigrant background. See Figure
2.3.</p></li>

<li>The variable is based on the person’s own country of birth,

these are derived from the CPR. From this variable SSB constructs
the following categories used for its migration statistics.</li>

<ul>
<li><p>Immigrants - persons born abroad of two foreign-born parents and
four foreign-born grandparents.</p></li>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.7.5.4</span> Federal Statistical Office of Germany on data integration in the absence of unique identifiers - Using machine learning to impute refugee status in survey data</h4>
<ol start="262" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Following the unprecedented increase in asylum applications in 2015
and 2016, the integration of refugees in housing markets, labour
markets and in civic society is still a major priority for policy
makers in Germany. Accordingly, policy makers demand for data on the
situation of refugees, in order to monitor the progress of
integration and to derive implications for integration policies. The
idea of integrating data sources to satisfy this demand is
intuitively appealing. Data integration is cost effective and
imposes no additional response burden since information is produced
by making better use of already existing data.</p></li>
<li><p>In general, countries differ with respect to their data environment
and hence face different possibilities for integrating data sources.
Differences largely depend on whether or not unique person
identifiers exist in administrative data bases and whether or not
the legal framework allows their use in official statistics. While
matching datasets via unique identifiers represents the gold
standard, the vast majority of countries will not be able to link
information on refugees via unique identifiers within the
foreseeable future. In this data environment statistical matching
offers an alternative tool for integrating datasets. Statistical
matching is usually described as the joint analysis of variables
that are not jointly observed but available in different datasets.
In contrast to record linkage that links information on identical
units, statistical matching can hence be framed as an imputation
problem in which a target variable in a recipient data set is
predicted based on information on similar units – “statistical
twins” – in a donor data set.</p></li>
<li><p>The data environment in which statistics on refugees and people in
refugee-like situations are produced in Germany is typical for many
countries: Germany uses administrative data on residence permits
from the Central Register of Foreigners (CRF) to identify refugees
and foreigners in refugee like situations. While the CRF confidently
identifies and comprehensively covers refugees, it does not provide
information on their socioeconomic characteristics or housing and
living conditions. In addition, German official statistics uses the
Labour Force Survey (LFS) for shedding light on the socioeconomic
characteristics and the structural integration of first- and
second-generation immigrants in Germany. While the LFS provides a
detailed socioeconomic picture on these immigrants, it does neither
confidently identify nor comprehensively cover refugees and
foreigners in refugee-like situations.</p></li>
<li><p>Considering the production of statistics on refugees and people in
refugee-like situations, the problem can be formally stated as
follows: the information from the administrative data set (donor)
are used in order to impute refugee status in the survey data set
(recipient). For imputation a set of common variables (C) is used.
The final aim is analysing the unobserved joint distributions of
refugee status (R) and socioeconomic characteristics (S).</p></li>

<li><p>This case-study aims at integrating the CRF and LFS via statistical
matching to combine reliable information on residence status with a
broad set of socioeconomic characteristics, e.g. educational
background and labour market participation. The common information
on citizenship, date of entry, age and gender are used to impute
refugee status for respondents of the LFS. For this task, a boosted
and post-pruned Classification and Regression Tree (CART - C5.0) in
the CRF is developed and used to identify refugees among LFS

alternative compared to traditional forms of data collection for
refugee hosting countries. Secondly, the field of data science has
developed rapidly over the last decade. Powerful classification
algorithms have emerged that have not yet been exhaustively tested

<div id="the-statistical-production-environment" class="section level3 ListParagraph">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.8.2</span> The statistical production environment</h3>
<ol start="272" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Before developing a statistical production system, the data sources
of this system should be determined. Based on their supervising body
in the national data production system, there are two types of data
sources which can feed these systems.</p></li>
<li><p>The first type is part of the national statistical system, this is
the administrative data source where the data owners are an
integrated part of the national public administration. In this case
the country’s government with its public administration is present
and a national legislation is available which regulates the asylum
procedure or IDP registration. Parallel to the national legislation
are specialized administrative bodies or custodian agencies
responsible for the IDP or asylum procedure and for the collection
of the administrative data related to the procedures.</p></li>
<li><p>In this case the statistical data are by-products of the
administrative procedure. In an optimal situation the IDP or asylum
procedures are supported by IT-systems, and case-management systems
where the data are stored and can be queried. This case-management
system is interlinked with a statistical sub-system, it means that
the case-management system should have an interface where the
statistical queries can be set. In this production system chain the
case-management system is the input for the statistical subsystem,
it is not part of the statistical data production system.</p></li>
<li><p>The statistical sub-system should ensure the ideal technical
environment for data production and for the metadata production
environment as well. The statistical production system should have
also a link to the data storage warehouse, which is a dedicated part
of the statistical production system. In the storage system the data
are stored, if possible, in so called cubes, these cubes should have
a link to the dissemination system which enables the statistical
data publication via user interfaces. According to the methodology
of the data inquiry we can differentiate between static systems
where the data can be requested via static tables e.g. Excel tables
or html tables. The other way is to enable the compilation of
user-friendly, interactive statistical tables.</p></li>
<li><p>The second type of data source describes an IDP or asylum system
where the national legislation is not so well developed as in the
first case, and a dedicated governmental custodian body for the
asylum procedure is not functional. Refugee status-determinations
can be undertaken by UNHCR in contrast to status determination
carried out by a government. In the latter case the responsible
agency for the asylum procedure is an international UN organisation
such as UNWRA or UNHCR. The data source is the administrative system
of this international organization which collects data related to
the IDP or asylum procedure and also disseminates statistics at the
international level.</p></li>
<li><p>If such an asylum related statistical system is available, the
international organization serves as the producer of the input for
the national public administration. A memorandum of agreement could
enhance the cooperation between organizations of public
administration and the UNHCR which is directly involved in providing
shelter for asylum seekers and refugees and in data collection (see
Part 2 <em>UNHCR Agreements and Memoranda of Understanding</em> for an
example of this).</p></li>
</ol>
<pre><code>&#39;*UNHCR collects data on persons in concern i.e. refugees,
asylum-seekers, internally displaced persons (IDPs), returnees and
stateless persons. The data collection includes information on
country of origin and of asylum, sex age and location or settlement

<li>The main obstacle to data collection is the lack of harmonised
definitions and measurement criteria which can occur in cases when
the country did not comply with the 1951 Geneva Convention relating
to the Status of Refugees (See IRRS Chapter 2), or in the case of
IDPs observe the <em>Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement</em><a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a>
The lack of harmonisation can be especially problematic if the
translation of definitions of the convention into national law is
not done in a systematic and harmonised way, and not in observance
of the Recommendations set out in the IRRS or IRIS. Other factors
which can make the data collection difficult are differences in
quality and periodicity.</li>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.8.3</span> The statistical database environment</h3>
<ol start="279" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>When establishing a statistical production system there are also
some criteria related to the technical details and functionalities
of the system which should be analysed more detailed. It is
recommended to develop a common hosting environment for production
databases, the idea behind the common production system is that it
strengthens standardisation of the statistical data production and
it minimises the number of tools used in statistical activities and
reduces training and support requirements.</p></li>
<li><p>It is recommended that the statistical data production system
should include a toolkit which enables the management of statistical
data, this toolkit should include different facilities, such as:</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>data migration<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a>,</p></li>
<li><p>security management,</p></li>
<li><p>database administration (management of user access rights)</p></li>
<li><p>data collection,</p></li>
<li><p>data validation,</p></li>
<li><p>data-query toolkit,</p></li>
<li><p>metadata management system.</p></li>
</ul>
<ol start="281" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>When planning a statistical data production system, it is essential
to design a centralized metadata storage system which enhances the
efficiency of metadata preparation, storage, access, management and
dissemination. The centralized metadata system addresses the
problems of fragmented metadata located in numerous databases. The
metadata sub-system of the statistical production system should meet
some basic expectations, such as:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>the metadata system should have a common structure, defining common
metadata items,</p></li>
<li><p>all statistical data should have appropriate metadata,</p></li>
<li><p>it should cover a broad group of user needs,</p></li>
<li><p>the metadata must be consistent across the different subject matter
areas.</p></li>
<li><p>The metadata system should accommodate any kind of metadata related
to the corresponding statistical data.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Eurostat’s Single Integrated Metadata Structure (SIMS)<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>The Single Integrated Metadata Structure is the dynamic inventory of
statistical concepts used for quality and metadata reporting in the
European Statistical System.</p>
<p>The Single Integrated Metadata Structure streamlines and harmonises
metadata and quality reporting in the European Statistical System (ESS)
and it decreases the reporting burden on the statistical authorities by
creating the framework for “once for all purposes”. It is an integrated
quality and metadata reporting framework, which ensures a flexible and
up to date system where future extensions are possible.</p>
<p>The system enables that the same concept names and the same quality
indicators are used in the different ESS metadata structures, it also
enhances the consistency with the SDMX statistical standards as it
stands in the SDMX Content-oriented Guidelines.</p>
<p>It has to be underlined that data users and data producers have
different needs on statistical information and this has to be reflected
by the quality reports that are addressed to them. The distinction
between the user and producer oriented quality reporting is assured
through the Single Integrated Metadata Structure.</p>
<p>Based on this approach there are two different quality reporting systems
available within the SIMS, the user-(U) and producer (P) –oriented
quality reporting. The short user-oriented quality report is implemented
through the improved visibility and readability of the quality related
concepts and the producer-oriented quality report (P) is implemented via
the ESQRS<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> report structure.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.8.4</span> Statistical dissemination process</h3>
<ol start="282" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>It is essential that the design of the statistical production
system (the statistical production database) should interlinked with
the dissemination system, this system enables the establishment of a
modernised tool for traditional statistical publications and
interactive data products.</p></li>
<li><p>For the dissemination system the data source is the statistical
production system, the production database, it increases the
efficiency of statistical dissemination and reduces the risk of
mistakes, enables more timely publication of statistics.</p></li>
<li><p>The improved statistical dissemination system ensures a common
layout and reduces the number of different software applications in
use. The recommended statistical publication tool should have an
interface for managing publication contents definition and it is
also necessary to have an interface for generating XML output file
in order to combine statistical data and metadata.</p></li>
<li><p>A workflow model should be developed which monitors the complex
statistical data production from the production of statistical data
to the production of metadata, through the storage of the
statistical data. This complex model also monitors the statistical
channels used for monitors.</p></li>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.8.5</span> Indicator system for measuring the design production systems and workflow<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></h3>
<ol start="286" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>In order to measure the effectiveness of the statistical production
system and workflow an indicator system should be established which
can measure the effectiveness of the statistical production with
indicators like, soundness of the implementation, the cost
effectiveness, accuracy and reliability, timeliness and punctuality
and last but not least accessibility and clarity.</p></li>
<li><p>A suitable indicator system can be seen in the table below, in the
following this indicator system is presented: the indicator
soundness of implementation measures the quality of the workflow in
the design and production system phase of the GSBPM structure. It
identifies the different sub-processes being part of this phase. The
soundness of implementation should take into consideration the types
of the data which are processed (admin data or survey type data) in
this phase, because it affects the specifications of the indicator
system.</p></li>
<li><p>It should be also outlined that the cost of designing a statistical
production system plays an important role, it is necessary to reduce
the costs of the different software tools. In order to achieve this
goal, the best solution is the use of common applications. The
products should be disseminated (see also Phase 7 <em>Dissemination</em>)
on an appropriate platform, e.g. on the home page of the body
responsible for statistical data production which can also increase
the costs of the statistical production but using optimal software
and technical solutions this cost can be reduced.</p></li>
<li><p>The indicator ‘accuracy and reliability’ measures the ratio of
quality indicators used as performance indicators, the source data,
integrated data, intermediate results and statistical outputs should
be regularly assessed and validated.</p></li>
<li><p>The next indicator, ‘timeliness and punctuality’ defines the time
frame which is available for the production in the different
sub-processes.</p></li>
<li><p>According to the last indicator in the list, ‘accessibility and
clarity’, the number of visitors of the home page or other social
media products of the statistical data producer is calculated.
During the performance of this statistical data production system a
quality indicator system can ensure a permanent feedback on the
production system.</p></li>
